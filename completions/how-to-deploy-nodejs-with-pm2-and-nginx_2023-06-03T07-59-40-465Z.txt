# Deploying Node.js Applications with PM2 and NGINX

Deploying a Node.js application can be a daunting task for any programmer. There are a lot of moving pieces, and it can be hard to know where to start. You have to worry about setting up the server, configuring security settings, and ensuring that your application is up and running optimally. 

Thankfully, there are tools that will help you design a reliable production environment for your Node.js application. In this tutorial, we'll be covering how to deploy a Node.js application using PM2 and NGINX. We'll be covering how to install and configure both of these tools, how to configure the server for optimal performance, and how to maintain the production environment to ensure that your application stays up and running. 

## What is PM2? 

PM2 is a process manager for Node.js applications. It helps to manage and keep applications running, and provides features like application clustering, auto-restart, automatic application log rotation, and more. PM2 is the most popular tool for managing Node.js applications, and is used by companies like Microsoft, Instagram, and Uber. 

## What is NGINX? 

NGINX is a web server and reverse proxy for HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, POP3, and IMAP protocols. It can be used to serve static assets like images and JavaScript files, and can also be used to proxy requests to other servers, such as Node.js applications. NGINX is extremely popular, and is used by companies like Airbnb, Netflix, and WordPress. 

## Step 1: Installing PM2 

To install PM2, the first step is to install Node.js and npm. Once you've done that, you can install PM2 with the following command: 

```
$ npm install pm2 -g 
``` 

## Step 2: Installing and Configuring NGINX 

The next step is to install and configure NGINX. Most distributions of Linux come with NGINX installed, but if you need to install it, you can do so with the following command: 

```
$ sudo apt-get install nginx
``` 

Once NGINX is installed, you will need to configure it for your application. For a complete guide on configuring NGINX, you can refer to the [NGINX documentation](https://nginx.org/en/docs/). 

## Step 3: Configuring the Server 

Once both PM2 and NGINX are installed, you can configure the server for optimal performance. Here are some tips for doing that: 

- Ensure that your application is running in a separate process from the web server. 
- Set up an HTTP port to receive and process requests. 
- Set up a second port to serve static files like images and JavaScript files. 
- Set up a logging system to record requests, errors, and other information about your application. 
- Create an upstart script to automatically start your application when the server is rebooted. 

## Step 4: Maintaining the Production Environment

Once the production environment has been set up, there are some steps that should be taken to ensure that it is maintained. Here are some tips for doing that: 

- Monitor your application for any errors or problems. 
- Perform regular security audits. 
- Update your application on a regular basis to ensure that it is running on the latest version. 
- Regularly monitor the system for any changes in performance. 

## Conclusion 

Deploying a Node.js application can be a daunting task. But with the right tools, it can be made much simpler. In this tutorial, we've covered how to deploy a Node.js application using PM2 and NGINX. We've covered how to install and configure both of these tools, how to configure the server for optimal performance, and how to maintain the production environment to ensure that your application stays up and running.
