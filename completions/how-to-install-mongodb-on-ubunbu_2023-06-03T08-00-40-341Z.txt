MongoDB is a cross-platform, NoSQL database system that allows users to store and manage data in a distributed and flexible way. It is the most popular NoSQL database and is widely used for its scalability, flexibility, and high performance. In this guide, we'll show you how to install MongoDB on Ubuntu.

# Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process, you need to make sure you have the following:

* An Ubuntu server with a non-root user that has sudo privileges
* Access to a terminal window

# Installing MongoDB

First, you need to add the MongoDB repository so Ubuntu can access the MongoDB packages. To do this, open the terminal window and run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 9DA31620334BD75D9DCB49F368818C72E52529D4
```

This command will import the MongoDB repositoryâ€™s GPG key.

Once the key is imported, you need to add the repository to the system. To do this, run the following command:

```bash
echo "deb [ arch=amd64 ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu bionic/mongodb-org/4.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-4.0.list
```

Now that the repository is added, you can update the apt package list so Ubuntu can access the MongoDB package. To do this, run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

Finally, you can now install MongoDB by running the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org
```

# Starting MongoDB

Once the installation is complete, you can start MongoDB by running the following command:

```bash
sudo service mongod start
```

If you want MongoDB to start automatically when the system boots up, run the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable mongod
```

# Verifying MongoDB

To verify that MongoDB is running correctly, open the terminal window and run the following command:

```bash
mongo --eval 'db.runCommand({ connectionStatus: 1 })'
```

If the command is successful, you will get an output similar to this:

```bash
{
  "authInfo" : {
    "authenticatedUsers" : [ ],
    "authenticatedUserRoles" : [ ]
  },
  "ok" : 1
}
```

This output confirms that MongoDB is successfully running on your Ubuntu system.

# Conclusion

In this guide, we have shown you how to install MongoDB on Ubuntu. We have also shown you how to start MongoDB and verify its installation. We hope this guide was useful for you.
