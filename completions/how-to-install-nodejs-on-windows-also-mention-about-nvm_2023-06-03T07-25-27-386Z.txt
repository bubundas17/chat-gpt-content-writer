# How to Easily Install Node.js and NVM on Windows

Node.js is a popular JavaScript runtime platform that can be used to create and run web applications. It provides a rich library of modules that simplify the development of complex web applications. It is widely used for creating web servers, back-end services, command-line tools, and other types of applications.

Node.js is an open-source project and can be used in any operating system. Windows is one of the most popular operating systems and Node.js is also supported on it. In this tutorial, we will learn how to install Node.js and NVM (Node Version Manager) on Windows.

## What is Node.js?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment for server-side scripting and development. It provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js is used for building server-side applications, command-line tools, and other types of software. It can also be used to create desktop apps and for cross-platform development.

## What is NVM?

NVM (Node Version Manager) is a command-line tool for managing multiple versions of Node.js. It is especially useful for developers who work with multiple versions of Node.js. NVM allows developers to switch between different versions of Node.js quickly and easily, without having to manually change configuration files.

## Installing Node.js on Windows

Installing Node.js on Windows is easy and straightforward. The following steps will guide you through the installation process.

1. Download the Windows installer from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. Run the downloaded executable and follow the installation instructions.
3. After the installation process is complete, you can verify the installation by running the following command in the command prompt: `node --version`.

## Installing NVM on Windows

NVM can be installed on Windows using the Windows installer. The following steps will guide you through the installation process.

1. Download the Windows installer from the [NVM website](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases).
2. Run the downloaded executable and follow the installation instructions.
3. After the installation process is complete, you can verify the installation by running the following command in the command prompt: `nvm --version`.

## Using NVM to Switch Between Node.js Versions

Once NVM is installed, you can use it to switch between different versions of Node.js. NVM makes it easy to switch between different versions of Node.js by providing the `nvm use` command. To switch to a specific version of Node.js, run the following command in the command prompt:

`nvm use [version]`

For example, to switch to Node.js version 12.18.3, you can run the following command:

`nvm use 12.18.3`

You can also install and use multiple versions of Node.js side by side. To install a new version of Node.js, run the following command:

`nvm install [version]`

For example, to install Node.js version 14.15.1, you can run the following command:

`nvm install 14.15.1`

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to install Node.js and NVM (Node Version Manager) on Windows. We have also learned how to switch between different versions of Node.js using NVM. NVM makes it easy to manage multiple versions of Node.js on a single machine.
