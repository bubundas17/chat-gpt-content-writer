Retargeting ads, also known as remarketing ads, can be a powerful weapon in your digital marketing arsenal. They're a type of online advertising that helps you reconnect with website visitors who didn't convert the first time they interacted with your site. Essentially, retargeting ads display to users who have previously visited your site, increasing the likelihood that they'll return to your site and complete the desired action, be it making a purchase or filling out a contact form. 

Here are some of the benefits to using retargeting ads in your digital marketing strategy:

1. Increase conversions: By reaching out to users who are already familiar with your brand, retargeting ads can help to keep you top of mind and increase the likelihood of converting those users into customers. 

2. Improve ad performance: Since retargeting ads tend to have a higher click-through rate than regular display ads, they can help to improve the overall performance and ROI of your advertising spend. 

3. Cost-effective: When it comes to online advertising, cost-per-click (CPC) can add up quickly. By targeting users who are already familiar with your brand, and are thus more likely to convert, retargeting ads can be a cost-effective way to drive conversions. 

4. Track user behavior: Retargeting ads allow you to track user behavior and adjust your marketing strategy accordingly. Understanding where users are dropping off in your sales or conversion funnel can help you identify opportunities for optimization. 

5. Increase brand awareness: By keeping your brand top of mind for users who have previously interacted with your site, retargeting ads can help to increase brand awareness and familiarity.

When it comes to implementing retargeting ads in your digital marketing strategy, there are a few best practices to keep in mind:

1. Segment your audiences: Not all users who visit your site are equally valuable or likely to convert. By segmenting your audiences based on site behavior or other factors, you can customize your ad messaging and bids for maximum impact. 

2. Use engaging ad creative: To capture users' attention and keep your brand top of mind, make sure your retargeting ad creative is visually engaging and on-brand. 

3. Don't overdo it: While retargeting ads can be effective, bombarding users with too many ads can lead to banner blindness or negative sentiment towards your brand. Set frequency caps and take breaks in your retargeting campaigns to ensure that users don't get overwhelmed.

Overall, retargeting ads are a powerful tool that can help increase conversions and improve the ROI of your digital marketing efforts. By following these best practices and continually optimizing your strategy, you can use retargeting ads to help push users down the sales funnel and towards a conversion.
