The rise of voice search technology is changing the game for search engine optimization (SEO) and digital marketing as we know it. According to a recent study by ComScore, 50% of all searches will be voice searches by 2020. This revolutionary new way to interact with technology is already having a major impact on how we use the internet. In this article, we'll explore why voice-enabled devices are so popular and how they are changing the future of search.

## Why are voice-enabled devices so popular?

Voice-enabled devices, such as Amazon's Alexa and Google Home, are quickly becoming a ubiquitous presence in homes around the world. These devices offer a new level of convenience, making it easy to set reminders, play music, and control your home automation devices all with voice commands. In fact, according to a survey by Google, 72% of people who own a voice-activated speaker say that their devices are part of their daily routine.

One of the reasons that voice-enabled devices are so popular is that they make using technology more accessible. For people who are not tech-savvy or who have disabilities, voice technology offers a more natural way of interacting with devices. In addition, voice technology is typically faster than typing, and it allows you to multitask while you search.

## How are voice-enabled devices changing search?

Voice search is having a profound effect on the way that people interact with search engines. For one thing, voice searches are typically longer and more conversational than typed searches. People tend to use natural language when speaking to their voice-enabled devices, rather than using the terse and abbreviated phrases that are common in typed searches. This means that search engines need to be able to understand and process more complex questions in order to provide relevant results.

Another way that voice-enabled devices are changing search is by giving more value to the top search result. When people use voice search, they typically ask for a single answer to their question, rather than a list of search results. This means that the top-ranked search result becomes even more important, as it will be the answer that is most likely to be read back to the user.

Voice search is also influencing how people use search engines. One of the main benefits of voice search is that it allows you to multitask while you search. This means that people are more likely to use voice search for quick answers to simple questions, such as weather updates or directions, rather than for complex research queries.

## What does this mean for SEO and digital marketing?

The rise of voice search is having a major impact on SEO and digital marketing. In order to rank highly in voice search results, websites need to have clear and concise content that answers specific questions in a conversational tone. Businesses also need to pay attention to local search, as voice searches are often used to find nearby businesses and services.

As voice technology becomes more prevalent, businesses will need to optimize their digital marketing strategies accordingly. This may include incorporating voice search into their SEO plans, developing skills for voice-enabled devices like Alexa, and creating marketing campaigns that leverage the unique opportunities offered by voice technology.

## Conclusion

Voice technology is rapidly becoming a major force in the world of search, and it's not hard to see why. Voice-enabled devices offer an unprecedented level of convenience and accessibility, making it easy to interact with technology in natural and intuitive ways. As the use of voice search continues to rise, businesses will need to adapt their digital marketing strategies accordingly. By adopting voice search into their SEO plans and marketing campaigns, businesses can take advantage of this emerging technology and stay ahead of the curve.
