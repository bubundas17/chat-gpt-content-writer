TOPIC: What is server-side rendering (SSR) in Vue.js, and how can I implement it

Server-Side Rendering (SSR) is a technique that allows Vue.js applications to be rendered on the server, as opposed to just in the client's browser. In this post, we'll look at what SSR is, why it's important, and how to implement it in Vue.js.

Why Use Server-Side Rendering?

One of the biggest advantages of SSR is improved performance. When a Vue.js application is rendered in the client's browser, there can be a delay before the content becomes visible. This is because the client has to download the JavaScript files, parse them, and execute them before the application can render. With SSR, the server handles the initial rendering, and sends HTML and CSS to the client. This can significantly reduce the time it takes for the content to become visible.

Another advantage of SSR is improved SEO. Search engines typically have difficulty with applications that rely heavily on JavaScript for rendering content. By using SSR, we can ensure that search engines can crawl and index our content, which can improve our site's visibility in search results.

How to Implement Server-Side Rendering in Vue.js

Implementing SSR in Vue.js can be a bit tricky, but with a few steps, we can get there. Here's what we need to do:

1. Install vue-server-renderer

We'll start by installing the vue-server-renderer package. This package provides a renderer that can create HTML strings from our Vue components.

```bash
npm install vue-server-renderer --save
```

2. Create an Express server

Next, we'll create an Express server that will handle the requests and responses. We'll start by creating a new file called `server.js`.

```javascript
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

app.listen(8080, () => {
  console.log('Server started on http://localhost:8080')
})
```

This creates a simple Express server that listens on port 8080.

3. Create a Vue.js component

Next, we'll create a simple Vue.js component that we'll render on the server. We'll create a new file called `App.vue` in a new directory called `src`.

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Hello {{ name }}!</h1>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      name: 'World'
    }
  }
}
</script>

<style>
h1 {
  color: red;
}
</style>
```

This component has a simple template that displays a greeting, a JavaScript section that defines a `name` variable, and a style section that sets the color of the heading to red.

4. Create a server-side entry point

Next, we'll create an entry point for our server-side code. We'll create a new file called `server-entry.js` in the `src` directory.

```javascript
import Vue from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'
import createRenderer from 'vue-server-renderer'

const renderer = createRenderer()

export default function render() {
  const app = new Vue({
    render: h => h(App)
  })

  renderer.renderToString(app, (error, html) => {
    if (error) {
      console.error(error)
    }

    console.log(html)
  })
}
```

This file imports Vue, our `App.vue` component, and the `createRenderer` function from the `vue-server-renderer` package. We then create a new Vue instance that renders our `App.vue` component. Finally, we call the `renderToString` method on our `renderer` object, which generates an HTML string from our component.

5. Update our Express server

Finally, we update our Express server to use our server-side entry point. We update the `server.js` file to look like this:

```javascript
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

const render = require('./src/server-entry')

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send(render())
})

app.listen(8080, () => {
  console.log('Server started on http://localhost:8080')
})
```

This tells our Express server to render our Vue.js component when a request comes in for the root URL.

Conclusion

Server-Side Rendering is a powerful technique for improving the performance and SEO of Vue.js applications. By rendering our application on the server, we can reduce the time it takes for content to become visible, and improve the visibility of our site in search results. While implementing SSR in Vue.js can be a bit complex, by following the steps outlined above, we can take advantage of SSR in our own projects.
