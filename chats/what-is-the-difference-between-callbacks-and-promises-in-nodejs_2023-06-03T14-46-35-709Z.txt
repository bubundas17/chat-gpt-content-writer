TOPIC: What is the difference between callbacks and promises in Node.js

Asynchronous programming is a crucial aspect of Node.js. With asynchronous tasks, you can perform non-blocking I/O operations that allow for better scalability and performance. Two common ways of handling asynchronous code in Node.js are callbacks and promises.

Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to an asynchronous function invocation. When the operation completes, the callback function is called with either an error or the result as arguments. 

Here's an example of a callback function in Node.js:

```javascript
function fetchData(url, callback) {
  // some async task, in this example using node-fetch
  fetch(url)
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => {
      // handle success
      callback(null, data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
      // handle error
      callback(error);
    });
}

fetchData('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1', (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
  } else {
    console.log(data);
  }
})
```

In this example, the `fetchData` function is passed a URL and a callback function. When the fetch operation inside the `fetchData` function completes, the callback is called with either an error or the fetched data.

Callbacks can become unwieldy to manage with highly nested code. To address this, promises were introduced.

Promises are objects that represent a value that might not be available yet but will be resolved at some point down the line. The value can be either resolved (successful) or rejected (failed).

Here's how you can use promises in Node.js:

```javascript
function fetchDataPromise(url) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // some async task, in this example using node-fetch
    fetch(url)
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => {
        // if successful, resolve the promise with the data
        resolve(data);
      })
      .catch(error => {
        // if unsuccessful, reject the promise with the error
        reject(error);
      });
  });
}

fetchDataPromise('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  })
```

In this example, the `fetchDataPromise` function returns a new promise object that encapsulates the fetching logic. When the operation completes, the promise is either resolved with the data or rejected with an error.

Promises can be chained together to create a more readable and maintainable code. The `then` method of a promise returns a new promise, which allows you to chain multiple asynchronous tasks together.

Here's an example of how to chain promises in Node.js:

```javascript
fetchDataPromise('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')
  .then(data => {
    // perform some additional asynchronous task
    return doAnotherAsyncTask(data);
  })
  .then(anotherData => {
    console.log(anotherData);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  })
```

In this example, the `doAnotherAsyncTask` function returns a promise that resolves with additional data. When the first promise is resolved, the second asynchronous task is executed. When the second promise is resolved, the final data is logged to the console.

While both callbacks and promises are useful for handling asynchronous code, promises offer better readability, maintainability, and error handling capabilities.

By understanding the differences between callbacks and promises in Node.js, you can more effectively manage asynchronous code in your web applications.
