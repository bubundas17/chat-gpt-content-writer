In Vue.js, error handling is essential for creating a robust web application. Handling errors is critical in preventing unexpected behavior from occurring in your application. In this article, we’ll look at some of the best ways to handle error handling and display error messages in Vue.js.

### Understanding Error Handling

Error handling is a process of managing errors that occur during the execution of your code. In Vue.js, errors can occur in several ways, including server-side errors, validation errors, and client-side errors.

### Handling Server-side Errors

Server-side errors occur when the server fails to fulfill a request made by the client. In Vue.js, you can handle server-side errors by using the `.catch()` method in your HTTP requests.

Here’s an example of how to handle server-side errors in Vue.js:

```
axios.get('https://your-api.com/get-something')
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.log(error.response.data);
  });
```

The `.catch()` method is used to catch any errors that occur in the HTTP request, and the error data is then logged to the console.

### Handling Validation Errors

Validation errors occur when user input fails to meet the specified criteria. In Vue.js, you can handle validation errors by using a form library and displaying error messages to the user.

Here’s an example of how to handle validation errors in Vue.js using the [Vuelidate](https://vuelidate.js.org/) form library:

```
<template>
  <form @submit.prevent="submit">
    <input v-model="firstName" />
    <span v-if="!$v.firstName.required">First name is required.</span>
    
    <button>Submit</button>
  </form>
</template>

<script>
  import { required } from 'vuelidate/lib/validators';
  
  export default {
    data() {
      return {
        firstName: ''
      }
    },
    validations: {
      firstName: {
        required
      }
    },
    methods: {
      submit() {
        if (this.$v.$invalid) {
          // Display error message to the user
          alert('Please fill out all required fields.');
          return;
        }
        
        // Submit form data
        console.log('Form submitted.');
      }
    }
  }
</script>
```

In the above example, we’re using the Vuelidate form library to validate the user input for the ‘firstName’ input field. If the input fails validation, an error message is displayed to the user.

### Displaying Error Messages

Displaying error messages is essential for providing feedback to the user when an error occurs. In Vue.js, you can display error messages by using conditional rendering and the `v-if` directive.

Here’s an example of how to display error messages in Vue.js:

```
<template>
  <div>
    <button @click="submit">Submit</button>
    <span v-if="errorMessage">{{ errorMessage }}</span>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  export default {
    data() {
      return {
        errorMessage: ''
      }
    },
    methods: {
      async submit() {
        this.errorMessage = '';
        
        try {
          // Submit form data
        } catch (error) {
          // Display error message
          this.errorMessage = error.message;
        }
      }
    }
  }
</script>
```

In the above example, we’re using the `v-if` directive to display the error message only if the `errorMessage` data property has a value.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, handling error handling and displaying error messages are essential for creating a robust Vue.js application. By using the best practices and techniques outlined in this article, you can create an application that is less prone to errors and provides a better user experience.
