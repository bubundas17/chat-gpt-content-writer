TOPIC: Key differences between relational and non-relational databases

TITLE: Relational vs. Non-Relational Databases: What's the Difference? 
META_DESCRIPTION: Learn about the key differences between relational and non-relational databases to help you choose the best type of database for your needs.

Relational databases have been used for decades, while non-relational databases are a much newer technology. As more data is being generated and stored, non-relational databases are gaining popularity. But what's the difference between these two types of databases? In this article, we will explore the key differences between relational and non-relational databases. 

## Relational Databases

Relational databases are structured databases that store data in tables with columns and rows. They are based on the relational data model and use Structured Query Language (SQL) to manage and manipulate data. Relational databases are the most commonly used type of database management system.

### Key Characteristics 

#### Data Structured in Tables
Data in a relational database is structured in tables with columns and rows. Each column represents a specific attribute and each row represents a specific instance of that attribute. 

#### Relationship between Tables 
Data in a relational database is stored in multiple, related tables. Relationships between tables are defined by the use of primary keys, foreign keys, and referential integrity rules. 

#### Schema Design 
Relational databases require a predefined schema, which is the blueprint for the entire database. It determines the data types, relationship between tables, constraints, and more. 

#### ACID Compliance 
Relational databases follow the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, which ensure data integrity, consistency, and reliability. 

## Non-Relational Databases 

Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, store data in various ways and structures. They are schema-less databases, which means they do not require a predefined schema to store data. Non-relational databases do not use SQL to manage or manipulate data.

### Key Characteristics 

#### Flexible Data Modeling 
Non-relational databases are flexible when it comes to data modeling. They can store structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. 

#### Horizontal Scaling 
Non-relational databases can easily scale horizontally, meaning they can add more nodes or servers to handle more traffic or data. 

#### Distributed Architecture 
Non-relational databases often have a distributed architecture. Data is stored across multiple servers or nodes, making it highly available and fault-tolerant. 

#### Lack of ACID Compliance 
Non-relational databases often do not follow ACID properties. Instead, they follow BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency) properties, which prioritize availability and performance over data consistency. 

## Choosing Between Relational and Non-Relational Databases 

Choosing between these two types of databases depends on your use case and requirements. If you are dealing with structured data with well-defined relationships between different tables, then a relational database may be a better option. On the other hand, if you are dealing with large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, then a non-relational database may be a better choice. 

In conclusion, the key differences between relational and non-relational databases include data structure, schema design, data modeling flexibility, scalability, ACID compliance, and more. Understanding these differences can help you choose the best type of database for your needs.
