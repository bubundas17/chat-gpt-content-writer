CATEGORIES: Industry Analysis, Emerging Technologies, Finance

The past decade has seen a steady increase in mergers and acquisitions across almost all industries. From technology startups to traditional manufacturing industries, consolidation has been a significant trend. Factors such as globalization, technology disruption, and the need for cost optimization are driving the trend. This article aims to explore the recent trends of industry consolidation and mergers, predict the future in several sectors, and explain the factors behind these predictions.

Manufacturing Sector

The manufacturing industry has seen significant consolidation and mergers in the past decade. According to a report by Deloitte, M&A activity in the global industrial products sector hit a five-year high in 2019. This trend is likely to continue in the future as manufacturing companies seek to expand their capabilities, optimize their supply chains, and regulate costs. With the rise of Industry 4.0 technologies, such as automation, data analytics, and artificial intelligence, smaller manufacturers may find it difficult to keep up. This creates an opportunity for larger companies to acquire smaller firms and integrate their technologies to stay competitive.

Energy Sector

The energy sector has also seen a significant trend towards consolidation and mergers. The sector has been under immense pressure due to declining oil prices, climate regulations, and geopolitical instability. A report by Ernst and Young revealed that global deal value in the oil and gas sector reached $234 billion in 2019, the highest since 2014. The pressure to optimize exploration, production, and distribution is driving consolidation and mergers in the energy sector. As renewable energy gains momentum, we can also expect a consolidation trend in this space.

Finance and Banking Sector

The finance and banking sectors have also been experiencing constant consolidation and mergers. In recent years, several global banks have announced mergers or acquisitions to stay competitive. For example, Barclays' acquisition of Lehman Brothers in 2008, and BBVA's acquisition of Compass Bank in 2007. According to a report by PWC, the global value of deals in the banking sector increased by 8.1% on a year-on-year basis in 2019. The trend towards consolidation in the banking sector is due to the need for financial institutions to grow and expand their capabilities, optimize their operations, and diversify their revenue streams.

Conclusion

Overall, industry consolidation and mergers have been a significant trend over the past decade, and it is expected to continue in the future. The factors driving this trend vary across different sectors, but the need to optimize efficiency and reduce costs is a common denominator. The rise of new technologies, such as automation and AI, is also driving consolidation, as firms seek to leverage these technologies to gain a competitive advantage. As we move forward, we can expect further consolidation and mergers across several sectors, creating both challenges and opportunities for businesses and consumers alike.
