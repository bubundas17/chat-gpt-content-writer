Smartphones have become an integral part of our lives nowadays, and choosing the right smartphone platform is a significant decision that can affect how efficiently we live our lives. iPhones and Androids are the two most prevalent smartphone platforms, and while both offer unique features, the choice can be overwhelming.

In this post, we will compare the latest Apple iPhones with the latest Android phones, taking into account design, performance, software, features, and price, to help you make the right choice.

**Design:**

iPhones have a signature design language that is sleek, minimalistic, and elegant. This year, the iPhone 12 series saw a design overhaul with flat edges and a slightly squared-off frame that looks refreshing and modern. On the other hand, Android manufacturers like Samsung and Google have been experimenting with new designs and materials. Samsung's Galaxy S21 and Google's Pixel 5 have an ergonomic design with a slim profile and rounded edges. Both platforms offer attractive designs, so it comes down to personal preference.

**Performance:**

Apple's A14 Bionic chip powers the 2021 iPhones, providing blazing fast performance that is unmatched by any Android phone currently out there. The chip is optimized to improve battery life while providing faster performance, making it ideal for intensive tasks like video editing and gaming. Android phones tend to use Qualcomm's Snapdragon chipset, which offers a slightly lower performance compared to Apple's chip but is still snappy and smooth.

**Software:**

A significant difference between the two platforms is the operating system they run on. iPhones use Apple's proprietary iOS, which offers a closed, secure, and seamless experience. The iOS app store is strictly curated, ensuring that users only download verified apps. Android, on the other hand, runs on an open-source platform that provides users with greater flexibility and customization options. Google's Play Store features over 3.5 million apps, but this also raises security concerns.

**Features:**

Both platforms offer unique features to set themselves apart. Apple's ecosystem provides users with a seamlessly integrated experience, with services like iCloud, FaceTime, and iMessage. iPhones also have superior camera capabilities, with stunning images, dynamic range, and night mode. Android devices have their own set of features, with many devices boasting superior screens, faster charging, and expandable storage. Android also provides better customization options, including changing the default apps, widgets, and the overall user interface.

**Price:**

Finally, the price is an essential factor when choosing your smartphone platform. iPhones are generally more expensive, with the iPhone 12 Pro Max starting at $1,099. Android phones vary in price, with Samsung's Galaxy S21 starting at $799, and Google's Pixel 5 starting at $699.

In conclusion, both platforms have their own strengths and weaknesses, and ultimately the choice depends on your needs, preferences, and budget. If you prioritize performance, a seamless and closed ecosystem, and high-end camera capabilities, iPhones are the way to go. However, if you value customization, expandable storage, and more affordable prices, Android phones are the ideal choice. Whatever your preference, there’s no doubt that both iPhone and Android are excellent platforms that are sure to satisfy.We hope this comparison helped you make an informed decision about which smartphone platform to buy in 2021. It's important to note that this is not an exhaustive list, and there are other factors to consider, such as battery life, screen size, and durability. It’s always a good idea to test out devices before making a purchase, to get a feel for them and ensure that they meet your needs.
