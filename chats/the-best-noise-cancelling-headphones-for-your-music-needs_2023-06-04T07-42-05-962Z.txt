Are you tired of having to turn up the volume as high as possible just to listen to your favorite songs over the sounds of traffic or your surroundings? Look no further than noise-cancelling headphones to enhance your audio experience. In this guide, weâ€™ll go over what to look for in noise-cancelling headphones, and give a handful of recommendations for different budgets.

What to Look for in Noise Cancelling Headphones:
1. Sound Quality - Look for headphones with a wide frequency range and good bass response. Headphones with AptX Low Latency codec will also ensure high-quality audio without any lag or delay.
2. Comfort - Look for headphones with soft cushioning around the ear cups and headband. Adjustable headbands and swiveling ear cups can also enhance comfort greatly.
3. Noise Isolation - Look for headphones that have active noise-cancellation technology that can block out ambient noise. Over-ear headphones often provide better isolation than on-ear models.
4. Wireless Connectivity - Look for headphones with Bluetooth connectivity for wireless listening without the hassle of wires.
5. Design - Choose a design that caters to your personal taste. Over-ear headphones tend to be bulkier, while in-ear models are more discreet.
6. Durability - Consider the build quality of the headphones, especially if you plan on using them while traveling.

Recommendations:
1. Sony WH-1000XM4 - These headphones offer top-notch noise cancelling, sound quality, and battery life. They also have touch controls, an equalizer app and are comfortable to wear.
2. Bose QuietComfort 35 II - Another top choice, with exceptional noise cancellation and comfort. The microphone system also works great for phone calls.
3. Jabra Elite 85h - Bluetooth 5.0 technology means there will always be a strong connection. Sound and noise-cancellation are great, and they are also durable with IP52 water and dust resistance.
4. Apple AirPods Pro - The ideal choice for iOS users, featuring active noise-cancellation and transparency mode to hear what's going on around you. They also have a secure and comfortable fit with the new silicone tips.
5. Sennheiser Momentum Wireless - The sound quality is amazing but the noise-cancellation is just average. The headphones have a stylish and attractive design. 

Ultimately, the best noise cancelling headphones for your music needs will depend on your personal preferences and budget. Take the time to research and try out different options to find the perfect pair for you!
