As more and more businesses operate online, cybersecurity has become an essential part of protecting company assets from threats. However, protecting your business from threats is not just about preventing attacks; it's also about ensuring security throughout the product life cycle. Cybersecurity in the supply chain is an essential component of this process, and today's organizations must recognize the importance of protection from the outset.

To have secure products, businesses must invest in cybersecurity throughout the product life cycle. From development to disposal, there are many phases in which cybersecurity can be addressed to ensure that each part of the supply chain is secure against a possible breach.

### PHASES OF THE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE

The product life cycle can be divided into various stages, including development, production, distribution, use, and disposal. Let's explore each of these phases in more detail.

#### Development

The development phase is where ideas are formed and plans are made. As a result, this stage is significant for creating a secure product. Cybersecurity should be a top priority during this stage as new security issues emerge quickly. Developers must work together, sharing security best practices to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities.

#### Production

When in the production phase, it is vital to maintain a secure and protected environment. Workers should be trained in proper security protocols and required to input certain credentials to access systems and information. Physical security must also be considered, such as ensuring that security cameras and other security monitoring systems are functioning properly.

#### Distribution

The distribution phase of the product life cycle is where products are sent to customers and retailers. It is necessary to establish proper procedures to ensure secure transportation and delivery. This phase is where the supply chain's security comes into play, ensuring that third-party vendors comply with the company's security standards.

#### Use

During the use phase of the product life cycle, business leaders face a wide range of potential security concerns. It is critical to have systems in place to detect and respond to security threats, such as having security software in place, providing employees with regular security training and highlighting suspicious behavior.

#### Disposal

Finally, the disposal phase requires that products are discarded securely, and customer data is wiped from any systems with which it may have come into contact. This is an often-overlooked area and represents a significant security risk.

### ENSURING SECURITY THROUGHOUT THE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE

Now that we have explored the various phases of the product life cycle let's go through some tips businesses can use to ensure cyber-security.

#### Proper Data Protection

Data protection is essential to keep customer information secure. It is critical that data is encrypted when stored and transmitted. When proper data protection methods are in place, cyber-criminals cannot access sensitive data even in the unlikely occurrence of a breach.

#### Threat Detection

While businesses take proactive measures, it is vital to have systems in place to detect and respond quickly to threats. Threat detection software is a valuable tool to identify potential security risks that may have gone unnoticed otherwise. Installing such software provides greater protection to a business's valuable assets.

#### Network Security

Securing a business's network is essential as it is the hub of all communication and information flow. It is necessary to have a secure network with stringent access control measures ensuring only authorized personnel can access sensitive information. Additionally, having regular monitoring of the network ensures an attacker is identified and dealt with promptly.

### CONCLUSION

Securing a business from cybersecurity risks is essential in every phase of the product life cycle. The tips provided in this article can guide businesses on the best practices to ensure that their products are secure, and customer data is kept safe. By addressing cybersecurity concerns throughout the supply chain, businesses can stay ahead of potential threats and stay protected in the future.
