Augmented Reality (AR) is transforming the way in which we perceive our surroundings, including the way that businesses advertise and market their products. The technology’s ability to layer digital information over real-world objects is the main attraction that brands have been utilizing in recent years to create interactive and immersive experiences for their customers. The result is a highly engaging and exciting way for advertisers to communicate with consumers, leading to an increased level of interest and loyalty.

AR has found its way into many different applications, including games, education, fashion, and of course, advertising. When it comes to advertising, AR can be utilized to provide unique digital experiences to customers. AR has been incorporated into print advertisements, billboards, social media, and more. It also offers marketers a novel way to leverage their creativity without the need for high budgets or technical skills.

How AR Works in Advertising

AR works by superimposing computer graphics onto the real world. Specialized tools and software are used in combination with hardware (such as smartphones) to create a 'real world' experience that incorporates digital media elements of 3D objects, videos, and audio. These elements can be used to engage a customer’s senses and provide a highly interactive experience.

One of the main advantages of AR is that it allows for ‘try before you buy’ experiences. By seeing a product in 3D before making a purchase, customers are more confident in their purchasing decisions. AR provides an opportunity for retailers to improve their conversions and reduce product returns by allowing their customers to engage with products digitally.

AR is also exceptional for promoting new products, especially when it comes to experiential marketing. It enables customers to interact with products or brand personas in a unique way. For example, an AR ‘virtual showroom’ can help customers visualize what products look like in a real-life environment.

AR in Social Media Advertising

With over 3 billion social media users, businesses find it an excellent advertising medium. Social media networks, such as Instagram and Snapchat, are making it easier for advertisers to incorporate AR into their marketing strategies. These platforms have implemented AR filters, stickers, and lenses, allowing companies to build an immersive brand experience through AR. 

Snapchat recently launched a shoppable AR feature that allows customers to purchase a product within the app after trying it on. Instagram has also been utilizing AR with a ‘swipe up’ feature leading to an augmented reality shopping experience.

AR in Outdoor Advertising

One of the most exciting areas for the use of AR is in outdoor advertising. AR-based campaigns, which use smartphones, have been used on billboards, street posters, and even on public transportation. These ad campaigns can track users' movement for interaction with various AR markers and locations, providing a highly engaging experience.

A recent example is Coca-Cola's AR campaign through buses in London. The campaign involved mobile users scanning the bus’s side with their smartphones to see AR animations, quizzes, and sound effects. This campaign created an immersive experience that not only promoted the brand but was also highly interactive and engaging.

Conclusion

The use of AR and its easy accessibility have proven to be a potent marketing tool for businesses of all sizes to boost their engagement with customers. The technology has an enormous impact on experiential marketing, allowing businesses to create immersive experiences for customers, ‘try before you buy' opportunities, and more. The possibilities of where AR can go in advertising are endless and will become a mainstream marketing channel to engage customers in the future.
