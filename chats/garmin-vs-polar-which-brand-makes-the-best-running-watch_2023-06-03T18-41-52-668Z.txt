Are you looking for a new running watch and cannot decide whether you should get a Garmin or Polar? These two brands are at the forefront of the sports watch market and offer premium features competing with each other. In this post, we will compare Garmin vs. Polar and determine which brand makes the best running watch.

Design & Comfort
When it comes to the looks of the watch, it's a matter of personal preference. Garmin watches are known to have a sleek and modern design with a high-quality display screen. Polar models, on the other hand, may not have such a swanky look as Garmin but are more lightweight and comfortable to wear during workouts.

Features
Both brands offer an extensive range of features aimed at runners, including heart rate monitoring, GPS tracking, and interval training modes. The two brands differentiate in their additional offerings.

Garmin is particularly good for data lovers, with more detailed data metrics such as ground contact time, heart rate variability, and running dynamics. Other features include music storage, Garmin Pay, and compatibility with a range of third-party apps.

Polar, on the other hand, is known for its smart coaching features, including recovery assessment, training load monitoring, and daily activity tracking. Polar's watches also offer sleep tracking, which many Garmin watches do not have. Moreover, Polar Flow web service is easy to use and displays progress charts that are motivating for fitness enthusiasts.

Price
Neither brand is inexpensive, so expect to pay a premium price for a premium watch. Garmin prices vary depending on the model but ranges between $150 and $800. Polar prices also vary, but the majority of their running watches are between $200-$400.

Verdict
Garmin and Polar both offer superb sports watches designed for runners. Garmin watches have more advanced data tracking and customization options, as well as music storage, but may not offer coaching and recovery features. Polar provides smart coaching and recovery features, as well as in-depth sleep tracking, but may not provide the same level of customization as the Garmin watches.

If you are an elitist athlete and extensively rely on data analysis to enhance your workouts, Garmin could be your perfect pick. If you are an average user looking to keep tabs on your day-to-day fitness activities or your sleep patterns, Polar watches are an excellent choice.

In conclusion, both Garmin and Polar are reputable brands and depend on what features are essential to you to make the right choice between the two.EndOFText
