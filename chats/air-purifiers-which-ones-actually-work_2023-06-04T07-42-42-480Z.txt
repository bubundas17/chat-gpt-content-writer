Air pollution is a growing concern around the world, with outdoor air pollution being a well-documented problem. However, many people are surprised to learn that indoor air quality can be just as bad, if not worse than outdoor air quality. Indoor air can be polluted by a variety of sources, including smoking, cooking, pets, and household cleaning products, among other things. 

Fortunately, air purifiers can help clean the air and create a healthy living environment. But with so many different air purifiers on the market, it can be difficult to choose one that actually works. In this guide, we'll take a look at some of the best air purifiers available, based on their performance, functionality, and customer reviews. 

## Why Do You Need an Air Purifier?

Before we get into the nitty-gritty of air purifiers, let's first understand why you actually need one. Air purifiers are particularly helpful for individuals with asthma or other respiratory problems, as these people tend to be more susceptible to the harmful effects of air pollution. Air purifiers can also be helpful for people who live in areas with high levels of outdoor air pollution, or for people who regularly use cleaning products or other household chemicals that can release harmful gases into the air. 

## What to Look for in an Air Purifier

When choosing an air purifier, it's important to look for certain features that ensure the purifier will be effective. Here are a few key features to look for:

- HEPA filter: A high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter is the gold standard for air filtration. It captures 99.97% of particles that are 0.3 microns or larger, including allergens, dust, and pet dander. 

- CADR rating: The Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) is a measure of how quickly an air purifier can clean the air. Look for a purifier with a CADR rating that matches the size of the room you plan to use it in. 

- Quiet operation: A loud air purifier can be distracting, especially if you plan to use it in a bedroom. Look for a purifier with a low decibel (dB) rating. 

- Features: Some air purifiers come with additional features, such as smartphone controls, air quality sensors, or a variety of fan speeds. While these features aren't strictly necessary, they can be useful in certain situations.
