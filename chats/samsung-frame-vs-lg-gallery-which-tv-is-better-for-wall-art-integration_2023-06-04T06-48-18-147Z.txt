Are you looking for a TV that can double as a piece of art on your wall? Samsung Frame and LG Gallery are two options that you don't want to miss. They both provide a seamless way to display high-resolution artwork when you're not watching TV. But which one is better for your home decor and budget? This article compares Samsung Frame vs LG Gallery to help you decide.

## Design and Features

Samsung Frame and LG Gallery have many similarities in design and features. Both TVs have a sleek and slim display style that blends well with any wall decor. They are available in various sizes, ranging from 43 inches to 75 inches, making it easy to find one that suits your room size and preference.

In terms of features, both TVs have 4K Ultra HD resolution, which delivers clear and crisp images. They also have HDR compatibility, which enhances the colors and contrast of the images displayed. Additionally, Samsung Frame and LG Gallery come with a range of pre-installed artwork, and you can also add your photos and artwork to them. 

The main difference between the two is that Samsung Frame comes with interchangeable bezels that allow you to customize the TV's frame. This feature gives you more flexibility to match the TV's frame with your wall decor or to change it whenever you want. Samsung Frame also has a motion sensor that turns off the TV's screen when no one is in the room, saving energy and prolonging the TV's lifespan.

On the other hand, LG Gallery has a unique gallery mode that displays artwork that looks like a museum or art gallery setting. This feature gives you an immersive experience and almost feels like you're in an art exhibition. LG Gallery also comes with a Magic Remote that you can point and click to select artwork or browse your photos. 

## Picture Quality and Sound

Samsung Frame and LG Gallery both have excellent picture quality and sound. They use advanced technologies, such as OLED, QLED, and NanoCell technology, to deliver accurate and vibrant colors. They also have built-in speakers that deliver high-quality sound, though some may opt to have a separate soundbar for improved audio quality.

Overall, Samsung Frame and LG Gallery are great options for those who want to display artwork on their wall and watch TV. They both have their unique features and design; it all comes down to personal preference. If you want a TV that you can customize and blend well with your wall art, Samsung Frame is the way to go. If you want a museum-like experience and a Magic Remote, then the LG Gallery is the better fit.
