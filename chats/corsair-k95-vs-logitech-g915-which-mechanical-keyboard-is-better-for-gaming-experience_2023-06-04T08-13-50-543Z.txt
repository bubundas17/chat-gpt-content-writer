Mechanical keyboards have been an essential tool for gaming enthusiasts for quite some time now. They offer a tactile response, personalized ergonomic feel, and can withstand the most intense gaming sessions, making them a staple for gamers worldwide. But with so many options to choose from on the market, where do you even start?

Two of the most well-known names in mechanical keyboards right now are Corsair K95 and Logitech G915. Both of these keyboards offer a premium gaming experience, and they both come equipped with unique features and functionalities. But how do they stack up against each other?

Let's take a closer look at the Corsair K95 vs. Logitech G915 and determine which one is a better investment for gamers.

## Design and Build Quality

The Corsair K95 carries Corsair's signature look with anodized brushed aluminum frame, providing a firm and robust feel. It measures at 18.3 x 6.7 x 1.4-inches and weighs about 2.92 pounds. It comes with a detachable wrist rest, which enhances your typing or gaming experience with additional support.

In contrast, the Logitech G915 features a sleeker, thinner design, with dimensions measured at 18.7 x 5.9 x 0.9-inches. It's constructed with aircraft-grade aluminum for durability, and Logitech managed to integrate all the necessary functions into a slim and beautiful keyboard.

The Corsair K95 takes the edge over Logitech G915 due to its impressive build quality and more substantial keyboard size. Logitech G915 has weight only 1.87 pounds and is ideal if you prefer a slimmer design.

## Switches

Now let's talk about the most crucial part of the mechanical keyboard: the switches. Both Corsair and Logitech offer their own custom-designed switches.

The Corsair K95 features Cherry MX switches, with options for Blue, Red, Speed, Brown, Silent, and Silent RGB. Cherry MX switches are known for their durability and responsiveness, making them a popular choice among gamers.

On the other hand, the Logitech G915 employs "GL Tactile," "GL Linear," and "GL Clicky" switches, custom-designed by Logitech. These switches are smaller than the Cherry MX, resulting in a slimmer keyboard design. And while they offer lower actuation force, they are less noisy, making them great for office use.

When it comes to switches, Corsair K95 has more flexibility with switch types, and Cherry MX switches are the preferred by many gamers.

## Keycaps and RGB Lighting

For some gamers, the aesthetics of their gaming keyboard are just as important as its overall performance. Let's see how both keyboards stack up in terms of keycaps and RGB lighting.

The Corsair K95 comes with double-shot PBT keycaps that offer durability and more extended use without fading. It also has a comprehensive RGB lighting system, individually backlit with 16.8 million colors. The Corsair K95's lighting system is customizable with the Corsair iCue software, which allows for the creation of custom lighting and programming of macros.

Similarly, the Logitech G915 has a full 16.8 million colors customizable RGB lighting system. But its lighting effects are only limited to the central light strip, located at the top of the keyboard.

In regards to keycaps, the Logitech G915 comes with ABS-plastic keycaps, which does not have the same longevity as PBT keycaps provided with Corsair K95. 

## Connectivity

Corsair K95 uses USB Type-A and has a pass-through USB port, which is great for additional peripherals. It also features dedicated media keys and a volume roller, which allows for quick audio control without the need to minimize or exit the game.

The Logitech G915 can connect with several devices through either Bluetooth or Logitechâ€™s Lighspeed wireless connection. Its onboard memory allows for easy switching between devices without having to reconfigure your setup every time you change devices.

In terms of connectivity options, Logitech G915 has more versatility than Corsair K95 by offering both Bluetooth and Lighspeed wireless connectivity options.

## Price

Lastly, price is an essential factor to consider. The Corsair K95 retails at around $199, while the Logitech G915 retails for approximately $249.

## Final Verdict

Both the Corsair K95 and Logitech G915 are exceptional mechanical gaming keyboards. However, the Corsair K95 edges out Logitech G915 for the win due to its impressive build quality, multiple switch options, PBT keycaps, and competitive pricing. The Logitech G915 doesn't fall short with its sleek design and connectivity options. For those looking for a comfortable typing experience, adjustable switches, and versatile connectivity, the Logitech G915 may be the preferred choice. But for the competitive and discerning gamer, the Corsair K95 remains a top pick for the ultimate gaming experience.
