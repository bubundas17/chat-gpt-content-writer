Node.js is a popular platform for building scalable and fast web applications. However, once you have built your Node.js application, deploying it can be a challenge. In this tutorial, we will walk you through the steps to deploy your Node.js application with the PM2 process manager and the Nginx web server.

## Prerequisites
Before we start, make sure you have the following:

* A server running Ubuntu 18.04 with a non-root user with sudo privileges
* Node.js installed on your server
* A Node.js application ready to be deployed
* Nginx web server installed on your server

## Step 1: Install PM2 Process Manager
PM2 is a production process manager for Node.js applications. It allows you to manage and monitor your Node.js applications, and provides features such as auto-restart, log management, and process scaling.

To install PM2, run the following command:
```
sudo npm install pm2 -g
```

## Step 2: Start Your Node.js Application with PM2
To start your Node.js application with PM2, navigate to your application directory and run the following command:
```
pm2 start app.js
```
Replace app.js with the name of your main Node.js file.

PM2 will start your application in the background and automatically restart it if it crashes. It will also create a log file in the location specified by PM2.

## Step 3: Configure Nginx
Nginx is a popular web server that can be used to serve static and dynamic content. It can also act as a reverse proxy for your Node.js application.

To configure Nginx, create a new server block by creating a new file in the /etc/nginx/sites-available/ directory. For example, create a file named myapp.conf:
```
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/myapp.conf
```

Add the following configuration to the file:
```
server {
    listen 80;

    server_name example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```
Replace example.com with your domain name or IP address. Change the proxy_pass port to the port on which your Node.js application is running. You can find this by running the following command:
```
pm2 list
```
Look for your application in the output and note the port number in the "PM2 Ports" column.

Next, enable the server block by creating a symbolic link to the /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ directory:
```
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/myapp.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

Finally, test the Nginx configuration and restart the Nginx service:
```
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

## Step 4: Test Your Application
Visit your domain name or IP address in your web browser to test your application. Nginx should be proxying requests to your Node.js application.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we have shown you how to deploy your Node.js application with the PM2 process manager and the Nginx web server. This will enable you to manage and monitor your application and serve it to the internet securely and reliably.-EndOFText-
