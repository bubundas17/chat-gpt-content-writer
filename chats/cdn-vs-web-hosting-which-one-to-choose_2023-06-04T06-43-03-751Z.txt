If you're planning to launch a website soon, you'll likely come across the terms 'CDN' and 'web hosting'. Both are crucial components for any website to function properly. However, new website owners often get confused about which one to choose for their site.

CDN and web hosting refer to two different technologies that work differently to improve website speed, performance, and security. In this article, we'll explain the differences between CDN and web hosting and help you choose the best option for your website.

## CDN: What is it?

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a network of servers that are distributed around the world to provide a faster and more efficient way to deliver content to users. When a user requests a web page from your site, CDN makes sure that the request is routed to the nearest server location, which results in faster page load times and improved website performance.


## Web Hosting: What is it?

Web hosting refers to the servers where your website's files are physically stored. When someone types in your website address in their browser, their request is sent to your hosting server, which then retrieves and sends the files back to the user's browser for display on their screen.


## Differences between CDN and Web Hosting

Now that we understand what a CDN and web hosting are let's take a look at their differences.

### Speed

CDN is optimized for speed and performance, making it an ideal solution for websites with large media files and heavy traffic. CDN achieves this by storing copies of your website's files on multiple servers distributed worldwide, reducing the distance and travel time needed to retrieve data from a single server.

Web hosting, on the other hand, has limited server capacity and only has one central location where your files are stored, which could cause delays in website loading time if too many visitors are trying to access your site at once.


### Security

CDN helps to improve website security by reducing the chances of a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. A DDoS attack happens when traffic floods your websiteâ€™s server to overload it. CDN can detect and absorb this traffic, ensuring that your site remains online and operating efficiently.

On the other hand, web hosting relies on server security protocols and firewalls to protect your website from such attacks.


### Cost

When it comes to cost, web hosting is usually less expensive than using a CDN. Web hosting plans typically offer cheaper services with flexible payment plans to fit your budget.

By contrast, a CDN can be expensive, especially for small businesses or websites that don't have high traffic. A CDN subscription will add an extra expense to your monthly hosting costs, which may not be feasible for websites with lower budgets.


## Conclusion

In conclusion, CDN and web hosting are both essential services to ensure your website operates effectively, but they serve different purposes. If your website has high traffic and contains large media files, using a CDN may be the best option. It will speed up website loading times, improve performance, and keep it secure from DDoS attacks.

However, if you're on a tight budget or have low website traffic, web hosting is the better option. It's more cost-effective and provides you with enough server capacity to meet your website's needs.

When choosing between a CDN and web hosting, it's important to consider your website's specific requirements and budget. Understanding the differences between these two services will help you make the right choice for your website.
