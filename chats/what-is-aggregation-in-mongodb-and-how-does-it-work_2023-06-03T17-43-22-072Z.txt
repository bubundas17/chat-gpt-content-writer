MongoDB is a leading NoSQL Database, widely used for data storage, processing, analysis, and management. MongoDB Aggregation Framework is a powerful tool for processing data, used to perform complex queries and analytics on your data. This framework comes handy when you require complex data analysis and processing tasks, and traditional queries and indexes may not suffice. 

In this tutorial, we will explore MongoDB aggregation framework, its working, and various stages to process your data efficiently.

## What is MongoDB Aggregation Framework?

MongoDB Aggregation Framework is a data processing pipeline that provides the capability to process data in various ways, such as filtering, grouping, sorting and transforming them based on the input data. The aggregation pipeline is made up of different stages representing individual operations, each providing a stage for the transformation of data in a series.

The aggregation framework is conceptually similar to Unix pipeline, where various commands are chain together the output of one command fed to the input of the subsequent command. 

## How does MongoDB Aggregation Framework work?

The aggregation framework works by transforming the data documents through various pipeline stages or stages of data processing. Each stage process the documents and passes the result to the next stage. The end result is produced when the documents have gone through all stages in the pipeline.

The Aggregation Framework comprises of the following five stages:

1. `$match` stage- filters out the documents that meet a specific criterion.
2. `$group` stage- groups documents based on specific fields in their values.
3. `$project` stage- reshapes the documents and output a subset of fields.
4. `$sort` stage- sorts the documents in either ascending or descending order.
5. `$limit` stage- limits documents count returned.

Additional stages include `$unwind`, `$group`, `$lookup`, meanwhile, we can also create effectively deep queries using the $map and $reduce stages in the aggregation pipeline.

## How to use MongoDB Aggregation Framework

Step 1: Create a Collection:

We'll start by creating a sample data collection â€“ fruits. To insert a document to the MongoDB collection, use the following command:

``` 
db.fruits.insertMany([
{ "_id" : 1, "name" : "Mango", "type" : "Tropical", "rating" : 4.4, "price" : 2 },
{ "_id" : 2, "name" : "Apple", "type" : "Temperate", "rating" : 3.8, "price" : 3 },
{ "_id" : 3, "name" : "Banana", "type" : "Tropical", "rating" : 4.2, "price" : 1.5 },
{ "_id" : 4, "name" : "Orange", "type" : "Temperate", "rating" : 4.1, "price" : 2.5 },
{ "_id" : 5, "name" : "Pineapple", "type" : "Tropical", "rating" : 4.6, "price" : 3.5 },
{ "_id" : 6, "name" : "Kiwi", "type" : "Temperate", "rating" : 4.2, "price" : 3.2 },
{ "_id" : 7, "name" : "Pear", "type" : "Temperate", "rating" : 3.9, "price" : 2.8 },
{ "_id" : 8, "name" : "Grapes", "type" : "Temperate", "rating" : 4.4, "price" : 2.5 },
{ "_id" : 9, "name" : "Pomegranate", "type" : "Temperate", "rating" : 4.7,"price" : 4 }
]) 
```

Step 2: Run an aggregation framework query

Now that we have created our fruits collection, we can run an aggregation query on it. Let's say we want to perform an aggregation pipeline that filters out all fruits that are not of tropical origin, sorts them based on their name, and adds a calculated field which is the price for each fruit discounted by 10 percent.

```
db.fruits.aggregate(
    { $match: { type: "Tropical" } },
    { $sort: { name: 1 } },
    { $project: { name: 1, price_dis: { $subtract: [ "$price", { $multiply: [ "$price", 0.1 ] } ] } } }
 )
 ```

The above query is the aggregation pipeline that takes fruits where type is tropical, sorts them based on name in ascending order, and outputs document containing only fields name and price_dis.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, MongoDB Aggregation Framework is an efficient way to analyze and process data, using a powerful pipeline of stages. It is essential that you understand the stages implemented in the pipeline to perform complex queries and data analytics. This guide has given you a detailed understanding of how aggregation works in MongoDB.We hope this comprehensive guide on MongoDB Aggregation Framework has helped you learn the basic concepts and stages of data transformation. MongoDB is a versatile NoSQL database, and the aggregation framework adds to this versatility, providing greater flexibility when analyzing and processing data.

We recommend that you further explore the MongoDB documentation on the Aggregation Framework to learn and understand other stages or operators that are not covered here. As you gain proficiency in Aggregation Framework, you can leverage it to handle large data sets and create complex queries.

We hope that this tutorial has provided you with useful information to get you started with using MongoDB Aggregation Framework. Feel free to leave any questions or comments below.
