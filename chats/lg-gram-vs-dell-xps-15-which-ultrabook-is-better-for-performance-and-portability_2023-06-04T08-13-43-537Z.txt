If you're on the hunt for an ultrabook that can keep up with you on the go, both the LG Gram and Dell XPS 15 should be top of mind. These lightweight laptops pack serious power for their size, making them perfect for anyone who needs to work on-the-go. But which is betterâ€”the LG Gram or the Dell XPS 15? In this post, we'll take an in-depth look at both laptops to help you choose the best one for your needs.

## LG Gram vs. Dell XPS 15: Specs

Let's start by comparing the specs of both laptops side-by-side:

| LG Gram  | Dell XPS 15 |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 11th Gen Intel Core i5 or i7 | 10th Gen Intel Core i5, i7, or i9 |
| 8GB or 16GB DDR4 RAM | 8GB, 16GB, or 32GB DDR4 RAM |
| 13.3", 14", or 17" display | 15.6" display |
| Up to 1TB SSD storage | Up to 2TB SSD storage |
| Up to 19.5 hours battery life | Up to 12 hours battery life |
| Starting at 2.2 pounds | Starting at 4 pounds |

Right off the bat, it's clear that the LG Gram is lighter and promises much longer battery life compared to the Dell XPS 15. However, the Dell XPS 15 comes with more powerful processor options, up to 32GB of RAM, and can hold more storage.

## Design and Portability

Both the LG Gram and Dell XPS 15 have sleek, visually appealing designs, with the LG Gram sporting a thinner bezel and lighter body. It has a glossy look and a gray-silver finish, while the Dell XPS 15 offers aluminum and carbon-fiber options.

While the Dell XPS 15's OLED display is impressive and a cut above the LG Gram's display, it's worth noting that its battery life can drain more quickly due to the power requirements of OLED technology.
