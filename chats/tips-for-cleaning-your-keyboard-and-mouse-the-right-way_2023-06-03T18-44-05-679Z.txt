Keeping your keyboard and mouse clean is essential for maintaining hygiene and extending their lifespan. Over time, dirt, grime, and germs can accumulate on and under the keys, making them more difficult to use and potentially spreading harmful bacteria. In this post, we'll give you expert tips on how to clean your keyboard and mouse the right way.

**Materials You'll Need**

Before you begin cleaning, you'll want to gather a few materials. You'll need:

- A microfiber cloth or compressed air canister
- Isopropyl alcohol (ideally 70%)
- Cotton swabs
- Soft-bristle toothbrush
- Dish soap and warm water
- Rubber gloves (optional)

**Cleaning Your Keyboard**

1. Shut down your computer to prevent any accidental keystrokes during cleaning.

2. Disconnect the keyboard from your computer. If you're using a laptop, make sure it's unplugged and the battery is removed.

3. Use the compressed air canister or microfiber cloth to remove any loose debris from the keyboard.

4. To clean the keys, dampen a cotton swab with the isopropyl alcohol and gently rub it over each key. Make sure to get in-between the keys as well. 

5. Use the toothbrush to gently scrub the surface of the keyboard to remove any stubborn grime.

6. If your keyboard is particularly dirty, you can also remove the keys using a keycap puller or a flat tool such as a credit card. Soak the keys in warm soapy water for a few minutes, then rinse and dry them thoroughly.

7. Once you're done cleaning, make sure the keyboard is completely dry before plugging it back in or turning on your computer.

**Cleaning Your Mouse**

1. Unplug the mouse from your computer.

2. Use the compressed air canister or microfiber cloth to remove any loose debris from the surface of the mouse.

3. Dampen a cotton swab with the isopropyl alcohol and gently rub it over the surface of the mouse, paying particular attention to the scroll wheel and buttons.

4. If your mouse has a removable cover or parts, follow the manufacturer's instructions for cleaning these components.

5. Once you're done cleaning, always make sure the mouse is completely dry before plugging it back in or turning on your computer.

**Extra Tips**

- To maintain cleanliness, try wiping down your keyboard and mouse with a microfiber cloth at least once a day.

- Avoid eating or drinking near your keyboard and mouse to reduce the risk of spills and sticky residue.

- Consider using a keyboard cover or skin to protect your keyboard from spills and prevent debris from getting stuck under the keys.

- If you're consistently working in a dusty environment, consider investing in a keyboard and mouse that are specifically designed to be dustproof.

In conclusion, cleaning your keyboard and mouse may seem like a hassle, but it's a crucial step in maintaining hygiene and improving performance. Follow these simple steps and you'll be able to keep your keyboard and mouse in top condition for years to come.
