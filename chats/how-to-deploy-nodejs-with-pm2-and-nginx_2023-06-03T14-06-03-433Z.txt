As Node.js applications become more popular, the need for stable and reliable deployment methods becomes increasingly important. In this guide, we'll walk you through deploying your Node.js application with PM2 and Nginx. 

# What is PM2?
PM2 (Process Manager 2) is a production runtime and process manager that allows you to keep your Node.js applications up and running even in the event of a crash. With PM2, you can start, stop, and restart Node.js applications with just a few commands. It also has built-in load balancing capabilities, which ensure that your application can handle large amounts of traffic. 

# What is Nginx?
Nginx is a high-performance web server that is commonly used as a reverse proxy and load balancer. It's known for its ability to efficiently handle a large number of concurrent connections and requests, making it an excellent choice for serving static and dynamic content. 

# Step 1: Installing PM2 and Nginx
The first step in deploying your Node.js application with PM2 and Nginx is to install both tools on your server. To do this, run the following commands:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nginx
sudo npm install pm2 -g
```
This will install the latest version of Nginx and PM2. 

# Step 2: Creating Your Node.js Application
After installing PM2 and Nginx, you'll need to create your Node.js application. Once your application is complete, run the following commands to start the application with PM2:

```
pm2 start app.js
pm2 save
pm2 startup
```
This will start your application with PM2, save the process list, and generate a startup script that will start PM2 and your application automatically when the server is restarted. 

# Step 3: Configuring Nginx as a Reverse Proxy
In order to use Nginx as a reverse proxy, you'll need to configure it to pass requests to your PM2 application. To do this, open the Nginx configuration file:

```
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```

Add the following code to the file:

```
location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
}
```
This code will redirect traffic from your Nginx server to your PM2 application running on port 3000. Make sure to replace "http://localhost:3000" with the appropriate address for your application. 

After adding this code, save and close the file, and then restart Nginx with the following command:

```
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

# Step 4: Enabling HTTPS with SSL/TLS
To ensure the security of your application and its users, it's a good idea to use HTTPS with SSL/TLS. To enable HTTPS, you'll need to obtain an SSL/TLS certificate from a trusted provider such as Let's Encrypt. 

Once you have your certificate, you can add the following code to your Nginx configuration file:

```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name example.com;
    ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/privkey.pem;
    ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
    ssl_ciphers 'EECDH+AESGCM:EDH+AESGCM:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH';
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

This code will force all HTTP requests to be redirected to HTTPS, and will also configure SSL/TLS. Make sure to replace "example.com" and the file paths with the appropriate values for your application and certificate. 

After adding this code, save and close the file, and then restart Nginx with the following command:

```
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```
