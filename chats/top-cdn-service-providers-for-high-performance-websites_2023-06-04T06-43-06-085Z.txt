Apart from the CDN service provider, there are a few factors that you should consider when choosing a CDN. One of the most important factors is the location of the CDN server. You need to select a CDN service provider that has servers located close to your website audience. This helps to reduce the distance data has to travel and improve website loading speed. 

Another factor to consider is the type of content that you want to deliver. If you have a lot of dynamic content like videos, images, and audio files, you need a CDN service provider that supports streaming and progressive download. Some advanced CDNs like Akamai and Cloudflare offer this feature. 

In conclusion, selecting the right CDN service provider can play a significant role in the overall performance, security, and user experience of your website. Choose a service provider that is reliable, affordable, and efficient and enjoy the benefits of a fast, secure, and reliable website. With these top CDN service providers, you can expect great performance enhancements for your website.
