In today's fast-paced business environment, productivity software has become a must-have for every organization. The two leading productivity suites in the market are Microsoft Office and Google Suite. Microsoft Office includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, and OneDrive, while Google Suite comes with Gmail, Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Drive. Both the suites have their strengths and weaknesses, and choosing one over the other may depend on the specific requirements of your business. 

Here is an in-depth comparison of Microsoft Office and Google Suite for businesses:

## Features

Microsoft Office has been the go-to productivity suite for businesses for decades. It offers an extensive array of features focused on creating professional documents, presentations, and spreadsheets. The tools and features of Office 365 work seamlessly on desktop, web, and mobile.

Google Suite, on the other hand, is cloud-based software that comes with minimalistic but efficient features. Google Suite is solely focused on cloud-based productivity tools. This means that businesses that prefer to create and store documents on the cloud might find Google Suite an excellent alternative to Microsoft Office.

## Collaboration

Collaboration is a crucial aspect of productivity software. Microsoft Office has come a long way in terms of collaboration. Office 365 users can edit documents together in real-time, share files with people outside the company, co-author documents, and also chat with team members without leaving the application. The collaboration features in Office 365 are one of the best in the market.

Google Suite, however, stands tall when it comes to collaboration. Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides are designed to let multiple users edit a document simultaneously. Users can suggest edits, leave comments, and even chat inside the application. Google also allows users to access revision history, making it easy to revert to a previous version of a document. The real winner here is Google Suite.

## Cost

Microsoft Office offers a range of options for businesses looking to use its platform. Its cloud-based platform, Office 365, offers three main subscription options: Business, Business Premium, and the Microsoft Productivity Suite. The cost of a subscription starts from $5 per user per month.

Google Suite has only one pricing option. A Business subscription is available for $6 per user per month. This includes unlimited cloud-based storage and access to all of Google's apps. Google Suite provides more value for businesses that require cloud-based functionality.

## Storage

Office 365 subscribers get 1 TB of storage per user for the cloud-based OneDrive platform. Additionally, users can buy extra storage with an Office 365 subscription. Users also have the option to use SharePoint and OneDrive to store documents in the clouds, and users can access files offline with the OneDrive app.

Google Suite users are entitled to 30 GB of cloud storage per user, with plans providing more storage at different rates as required for business. The Google Drive app also offers offline access to files. Even though Google Suite provides less storage than Office 365, it is sufficient enough for most businesses.

## Mobile Integration

Both Microsoft Office and Google Suite offer mobile applications for Android and iOS devices. The Office 365 app provides mobile access to all of its office application platforms, whereas the Google Suite app offers separate apps for Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides, among others. Google Suite's mobile application has slightly better functionality when it comes to collaboration.

After undertaking an in-depth comparison of Microsoft Office and Google Suite for businesses, it is a close call. Both suites provide a wealth of features and are effective tools for improving productivity and collaboration in the workplace. However, Google Suite has a more robust cloud-based solution that fits in the current business environment, and it edges Microsoft Office as the preferred enterprise productivity suite.
