If you're in the market for a new mouse, you've likely come across two options: the Logitech MX Master and the Microsoft Surface Mouse. Both of these mice are among the top-rated options on the market today, but there are key differences to consider when choosing between the two. In this post, we'll compare design, features, and overall performance to help you make the choice that's best for you. 

**Design** 

In terms of design, the Logitech MX Master has a distinctive look that sets it apart. It has a wider grip and a more contoured shape than the Microsoft Surface Mouse, making it a bit more comfortable to hold in your hand for extended periods of time. It also has a thumb rest and six programmable buttons that are easily accessible for enhanced functionality during use. 

The Microsoft Surface Mouse, on the other hand, has a sleeker profile and is more compact in size. It is also more lightweight, making it slightly more portable than the Logitech MX Master. Its overall minimalist design will appeal to users who prefer function over form. 

**Features** 

Both the Logitech MX Master and the Microsoft Surface Mouse have a range of features that set them apart from other mice in their class. 

The Logitech MX Master features a dual-mode scroll wheel that can switch between precision and hyper-fast scrolling for fast navigation through long documents or webpages. The mouse also has a unique thumb wheel that can be used for horizontal navigation or assigned to carry out various commands, providing an extra level of customization. Additionally, it has a rechargeable battery that can last up to 40 days on a single charge, reducing the need for frequent replacement of batteries. 

The Microsoft Surface Mouse has a simple scroll wheel and no extra buttons, leading to a cleaner setup with fewer customizable options. However, it does have a touch panel that allows for easy scrolling and allows you to click or tap anywhere on the panel to perform actions like opening the Start menu or switching between apps. It runs on two AAA batteries, which can be replaced quickly. 

**Performance** 

In terms of performance, the Logitech MX Master has a higher sensitivity of up to 4000 DPI, giving it a slight edge over the 1000 DPI of the Microsoft Surface Mouse. This means that the cursor will move more quickly and accurately on higher resolution displays, making it ideal for graphic designers or professionals who work with detailed spreadsheets or documents. However, both mice offer very precise tracking and smooth scrolling, making either option a great choice for general use. 

**Conclusion** 

In the end, the choice between the Logitech MX Master and the Microsoft Surface Mouse comes down to personal preference. If you're looking for a mouse with a wider grip, more customizable buttons, and higher sensitivity for more detailed work, the Logitech MX Master is a fantastic option. On the other hand, if you prioritize portability, simplicity, and a minimalist design, the Microsoft Surface Mouse is the way to go. Regardless of which option you choose, you'll end up with a high-quality mouse that is sure to enhance your computing experience.
