TOPIC: How do I install third-party libraries in Python

Python is a powerful programming language that offers a wide variety of libraries to make programming easier. While Python comes with a default set of libraries, you might find that you need to use a third-party library for your project. Third-party libraries provide additional functionality that is not available in the default set of libraries.

Installing third-party libraries in Python is not complicated, but for beginners, it can be challenging. In this guide, we will go through the step-by-step process of installing third-party libraries in Python.

### Step 1: Choose the Library

The first step is to choose the library that you want to install. You can search for libraries on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), which is Python's official package repository. PyPI has over 300,000 packages available, so you are likely to find what you need. Once you have found the library you want to install, you need to note down the name of the library.

### Step 2: Install pip

pip is a package manager for Python that is used to install third-party libraries. It comes pre-installed with Python 3.4 and above, but if you are using an earlier version of Python, you will need to install it manually. To install pip, go to [this link](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) and follow the instructions for your operating system.

### Step 3: Open the Command Prompt or Terminal

To install the library, you need to open the command prompt or terminal. On Windows, you can open the command prompt by pressing the `Windows + R` key and typing `cmd` in the Run dialog box. On macOS and Linux, you can open the terminal from the applications menu.

### Step 4: Install the Library

To install the library, you need to use the `pip install` command followed by the name of the library. Here's an example:

```pip install requests```

This command will install the `requests` library. You can also install a specific version of the library by adding the version number after the library name. For example:

```pip install requests==2.22.0```

This command will install version 2.22.0 of the `requests` library.

### Step 5: Verify the Installation

Once the library is installed, you need to verify the installation. You can do this by opening the Python shell and importing the library. Here's an example:

```python
import requests
response = requests.get("https://www.google.com")
print(response.status_code)
```

This code imports the `requests` library and uses it to make a GET request to Google's homepage. If the installation is successful, you should see a `200` status code in the output.

### Recap

To install a third-party library in Python, you need to follow these steps:

1. Choose the library
2. Install pip
3. Open the command prompt or terminal
4. Install the library using pip
5. Verify the installation

Once you have installed the library, you can import it into your Python code and start using it.

By following this guide, you should now know how to install third-party libraries in Python. Happy coding!
