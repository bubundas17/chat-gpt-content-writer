If you're in the market for a smart doorbell, two of the most popular options are the Nest Hello and the Ring Pro. Both of these devices offer advanced features such as motion detection, 2-way audio, and video recording that can be viewed on your smartphone. In this blog post, we will be comparing the Nest Hello and Ring Pro to determine which device has better video quality and features. 

Video Quality:

The Nest Hello has a 1600 x 1200 resolution camera that allows for a clear and crisp image. It also has a 4:3 aspect ratio, which provides a wider field of view, allowing you to see more of what's going on outside your front door. The Nest Hello also has HDR (High Dynamic Range) technology, which can help to reduce glare caused by sunlight or other bright lights.

The Ring Pro, on the other hand, has a 1080p resolution camera with a 16:9 aspect ratio. While the resolution is not as high as the Nest Hello, the Ring Pro has a slightly wider view, which can be helpful if you want to see more of the surrounding area. However, the Ring Pro does not have HDR technology, which can result in some glare in bright sunlight or other lighting conditions.

Features:

Both the Nest Hello and Ring Pro have similar features, but the Nest Hello has a slight edge when it comes to functionality. For example, the Nest Hello has facial recognition, which allows you to set up alerts for specific people. This feature can be especially handy if you have children who come home from school at a specific time or if you have a housekeeper or pet sitter who visits frequently.

The Ring Pro, on the other hand, does not have facial recognition but does offer customizable motion detection zones. You can set up to 3 motion zones to trigger alerts when motion is detected, which can help to reduce false alerts.

Both devices allow for live streaming and 2-way audio, which means you can talk to whoever is at your front door, even if you're not at home. The Ring Pro also offers "Pre-Roll" video, which captures four seconds of video before motion is detected. This feature can be particularly helpful if someone is moving quickly, as it can be hard to catch all the action in just a few seconds.

Conclusion:

Both the Nest Hello and Ring Pro are excellent smart doorbells, but which one is better for you will depend on your specific needs. The Nest Hello has better video quality, a wider field of view, and facial recognition technology, which can be very useful for some users. The Ring Pro, on the other hand, has slightly wider views, customizable motion detection, and "Pre-Roll" video. Ultimately, you can't go wrong with either device, so choose the one that best fits your specific needs.
