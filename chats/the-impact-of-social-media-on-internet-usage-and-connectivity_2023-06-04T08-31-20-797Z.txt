Social media has revolutionized the way we connect online. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn and more have transformed the way we share and communicate with others. With billions of active users worldwide, social media has become an integral part of our daily lives. In this article, we will explore how social media has impacted internet usage and connectivity in general.

### Social media fuels internet usage

Social media has become the primary driver of internet usage worldwide. With an estimated 3.81 billion social media users in 2020, it is not hard to see why. According to a study by GlobalWebIndex, the average daily time spent on social media is approximately 142 minutes, which is roughly two and half hours. This represents a significant portion of the time people spend online.

The rise of social media has also led to an increase in the volume of online communication. According to a report by Hootsuite, over 500 million tweets are sent on Twitter daily. Similarly, WhatsApp sees an average of 65 billion messages sent on its platform every day.

### The impact of social media on connectivity

Social media platforms have also impacted internet connectivity in profound ways. With platforms like Facebook and Instagram, people can now interact with each other in real time, irrespective of geographical location. This has helped bridge the gap of distance and created a sense of global community.

In addition, social media has led to an increase in internet penetration, particularly in developing countries. According to a report by We Are Social and Hootsuite, the number of internet users increased by 9.1% in 2019 to reach a total of 4.39 billion users. A significant portion of this increase was attributed to the growth of social media.

### Challenges posed by social media

While social media has undoubtedly impacted internet usage and connectivity in positive ways, it has also created its own set of challenges. For instance, it has led to an increase in cyberbullying and online harassment. Social media platforms have also been accused of promoting fake news and extremist propaganda.

### Conclusion

Social media has transformed the way we connect and communicate online. It has become the primary driver of internet usage worldwide, and impacted internet connectivity in profound ways. Its growth has helped increase internet penetration, particularly in developing countries. However, it is not without its challenges. Addressing these challenges is crucial to ensure the continued growth of social media as a positive force for change in the digital world.
