MARKDOWN_POST_CONTENT:

As we spend more time at home, it's no surprise that people are investing in enhancing their living spaces. From small updates to complete remodels, the world of home design and decor is constantly evolving. If you're looking for inspiration, here are some of the latest trends in home decor.

### What's In

**Biophilic Design**

Biophilic design, which aims to bring nature indoors, is gaining popularity in 2021. This includes using natural materials like wood and stone, as well as incorporating plants and greenery into your space. Adding natural elements can help reduce stress and increase productivity, making your home a more peaceful and welcoming environment.

**Maximalist Design**

While minimalism has been popular in recent years, maximalist design is making a comeback. This style embraces bold colors, intricate patterns, and lots of texture. Mix and match different colors and patterns to create a unique and eclectic space.

**Eco-Friendly Materials**

Sustainability is becoming increasingly important in home decor. Look for eco-friendly materials like bamboo, recycled plastic, and organic cotton. Not only are these materials better for the environment, but they also add a natural and rustic charm to your home.

**Multifunctional Spaces**

With many people working from home, it's important to designate a space for work, but the trend now is towards creating multifunctional spaces that are both beautiful and practical. For example, a home office can be transformed into a cozy reading nook when not in use.

### What's Out

**All White Everything**

While white can make a space look clean and bright, the trend towards all-white decor is starting to fade out. Instead, try incorporating pops of color or other neutrals for a more layered and interesting look.

**Open Shelving**

Open shelving has been popular in recent years for its minimalist and modern look, but it can be hard to keep organized and can easily become cluttered. Consider switching to closed cabinets or adding some storage baskets to keep your space both tidy and stylish.

**Fussy Decor**

Decorative items like doilies and lace curtains are no longer in style. Instead, opt for minimalist decor that has both form and function. Natural elements like plants and textured fabrics can add visual interest while still maintaining a sleek and modern aesthetic.

In conclusion, these are just a few of the latest trends in home decor. Whether you're into maximalism or minimalism, there is something for everyone. Just remember to choose elements that speak to you and make your home a reflection of your personal style.
