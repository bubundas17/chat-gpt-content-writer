6. Create a plan: If you're anxious about a specific situation, creating a plan can help you feel more in control. By having a plan in place, you can focus on what you can control and feel more prepared for the situation.

7. Take action: Sometimes, the best way to overcome fear and anxiety is to take action. Once you identify what's making you anxious, take small steps to address it. This can help you build confidence and feel more in control.
