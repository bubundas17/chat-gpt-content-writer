The internet has transformed the way we live, work, and communicate, making it an essential part of our daily lives. However, as technology has advanced, so too have the tools at the disposal of criminals wanting to target unsuspecting users online. Cybercrime continues to rise, with increased digitization and changing workplace dynamics creating new vulnerabilities for hackers to exploit. So, what do you need to know about the current state of cybercrime in 2021? 

## The Scope of Cybercrime 

Cybercrime refers to any illegal activity that is carried out online. This includes hacking, phishing, ransomware, identity theft, malware, and more. Recent statistics demonstrate the scope of the issue:

- Cybercrime is projected to cost businesses over $6 trillion per year globally by 2021. 

- In 2020, 56% of organizations reported an increase in cybersecurity incidents, with phishing and ransomware attacks seeing a significant uptick.

- Cryptocurrency-related crimes increased by 311% in 2020 compared to the previous year.

- The frequency of data breaches increased by 273% in Q1 2021 when compared to the same period in 2020.

## Understanding the Threat Landscape in 2021 

To combat cybercrime effectively, it is essential to understand the current threat landscape. Cybercriminals use increasingly sophisticated techniques to attempt to steal data and defraud individuals or organizations. Some of the most common types of cyber threats include:

### Phishing 

Phishing is the fraudulent practice of sending an email that appears to be from a reputable source to trick someone into providing sensitive data, such as login credentials or financial information. According to the FBI, phishing scams have surged by 300% since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Ransomware 

Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts an individual or organization's data and demands payment in exchange for restoring access. This type of attack has seen a significant increase, with incidents increasing by 150% in 2020, compared to 2019.

### Malware 

Malware is any software that is designed to harm or disrupt a system, such as a virus or spyware. Malware can be delivered through emails, website downloads, social engineering tactics, or physical media.

### Data Breaches 

Data breaches are becoming increasingly common, with attacks on large corporations, government agencies, and other organizations making headlines on a frequent basis. A data breach occurs when an unauthorized party gains access to sensitive information, such as customer data, credit card information, and data backups. 

## Protecting Yourself and Your Business 

The rise of cybercrime means that protecting sensitive information is more critical than ever before. Here are some tips to keep in mind:

- Use strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication wherever possible.
- Keep software up to date and use an antivirus program.
- Educate employees on how to identify and avoid phishing scams.
- Regularly backup data and store it securely.
- Consider investing in cyber insurance to help mitigate the financial impact of a data breach or other cyber attack.

## Conclusion 

Cybercrime is a growing threat, and as technology continues to advance, the risk will only increase. It is vital to understand the current threat landscape and take steps to protect yourself and your business. Don't wait until it's too late; take action today to safeguard yourself against cybercriminals.
