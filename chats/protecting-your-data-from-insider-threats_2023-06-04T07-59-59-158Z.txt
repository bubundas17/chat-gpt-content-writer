Insider threats are one of the biggest risks to data security. According to the Ponemon Institute, 60% of data breaches are caused by insiders, whether malicious or accidental. Insider threats can come from employees, contractors, or partners who have access to your company's data. These threats can be intentional, such as theft of data for financial gain, or unintentional, such as accidental deletion or emailing of sensitive information. Regardless of the intent, insider threats can cause significant damage to your company's reputation, finances, and operations. In this guide, we will discuss the 10 insider threats to data security and how you can protect against them.

1. Malicious insiders
The most dangerous type of insider threat is a malicious insider. These are individuals who have access to your data and intentionally try to steal or damage it. This could be a disgruntled employee looking to sabotage your company or an external hacker who has gained unauthorized access to your system through an employee's login credentials. To protect against malicious insiders, it is important to have robust access controls and monitoring in place, limit employee access to sensitive information, and conduct regular security awareness training.

2. Accidental insiders
Accidental insiders are individuals who unintentionally cause data breaches. This could be due to human error, such as sending an email with sensitive information to the wrong recipient or failing to properly dispose of data. To prevent accidental insider threats, it is important to have strict data handling and disposal policies in place, provide regular training on data handling best practices, and implement data loss prevention technologies.

3. Careless insiders
Careless insiders are individuals who are not malicious, but are negligent in their handling of data. This could include employees who use weak passwords or leave their computers unlocked, making it easy for unauthorized individuals to access sensitive information. To prevent careless insider threats, it is important to have strong password policies, implement two-factor authentication, and enforce strict access controls.

4. Insider collusion
Insider collusion occurs when two or more individuals work together to steal or damage data. This could include employees working together to sell data to a third party or to disrupt company operations. To prevent insider collusion, it is important to have robust access controls, conduct background checks on employees, and implement monitoring and auditing tools to detect suspicious activity.

5. Phishing attacks
Phishing attacks are one of the most common types of cyber attacks and can result in insider threats if an employee falls for the scam and unknowingly provides their login credentials to a hacker. To prevent phishing attacks, it is important to provide regular security awareness training, implement email security tools, and use two-factor authentication.

6. Social engineering
Social engineering is a technique used by hackers to manipulate individuals into revealing sensitive information. This could include posing as an IT helpdesk technician and requesting an employee's login credentials. To prevent social engineering attacks, it is important to provide regular security awareness training and to verify all requests for sensitive information.

7. Insider theft
Insider theft occurs when an employee steals sensitive data for personal gain. This could include stealing customer information to sell on the black market or stealing intellectual property to start a competing business. To prevent insider theft, it is important to have strict access controls, conduct background checks on employees, and implement monitoring and auditing tools to detect suspicious activity.

8. Privilege abuse
Privilege abuse occurs when an employee abuses their access privileges to steal or misuse data. This could include an IT administrator who accesses confidential files outside of their job responsibilities. To prevent privilege abuse, it is important to have strict access controls, conduct regular security audits, and limit employee access to sensitive data.

9. Insider negligence
Insider negligence occurs when an employee fails to follow company policies and procedures for data handling and storage. This could include storing sensitive data on unsecured devices or sharing data through unsecured channels. To prevent insider negligence, it is important to provide regular training on data handling best practices and implement data loss prevention technologies.

10. Insider sabotage
Insider sabotage occurs when an employee intentionally causes harm to your company's data or infrastructure. This could include deleting data or installing malware on company systems. To prevent insider sabotage, it is important to monitor employee activity, restrict access to critical systems, and conduct regular security audits.

Protecting against insider threats requires a multi-layered approach that involves technology, policies, and training. By implementing robust access controls, regular security awareness training, and monitoring and auditing tools, you can reduce the risk of insider threats and protect your data from malicious and accidental breaches.
