SimpliSafe also offers smart home integration, allowing you to control your system from your smartphone or voice control device.

2. ADT
ADT has been a leader in the home security industry for decades, and it's no surprise why. Their systems come with a range of sensors and detectors, including motion, glass break, and smoke detectors. ADT also offers professional monitoring services and smart home integration.
