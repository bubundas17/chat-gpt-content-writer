Both Costa and Oakley are popular brands known for producing high-quality sunglasses. However, which one is better? In this post, we will be comparing Costa and Oakley to determine which brand reigns supreme for outdoor activities such as hiking, fishing, and skiing.

**Costa Sunglasses**

Costa has been producing sunglasses since 1983. The brand is well-known for designing sunglasses specifically for fishing activities. One of the unique aspects of Costa sunglasses is that they are environmentally friendly. The lenses are made from 100% recycled materials, and the packaging is made from eco-friendly materials. 

But what about the functionality of the sunglasses? Costa sunglasses feature polarized lenses that reduce glare, enabling you to see underwater more efficiently. They also help to reduce eye strain, making them ideal for long hours of outdoor activities. Costa lenses come in different hues, each having a specific use. For example, blue-tinted lenses are ideal for offshore fishing, grey-tinted lenses are suitable for bright conditions, and amber lenses are perfect for low light conditions.

Costa also offers stylish frames that cater to different head shapes and sizes. The frames are lightweight, ensuring that they do not feel heavy on your face, making them perfect for all-day wear. Costa frames are durable and designed to withstand harsh environments.

**Oakley Sunglasses**

Oakley has been producing sunglasses since 1975 and is known for designing products specifically for athletes and outdoor enthusiasts. Like Costa, Oakley also uses polarized lenses that help to reduce glare. Oakley lenses are also impact-resistant, making them ideal for activities that involve flying debris such as skiing and mountain biking.

**Which is Better?**

Costa and Oakley are both popular brands known for producing high-quality sunglasses. However, when it comes to outdoor activities, the better brand depends on the type of activity and personal preferences.

If you are into water activities such as fishing and boating, then Costa sunglasses are the way to go. The polarized lenses help to reduce glare and improve visibility. Costa sunglasses are also perfect for individuals who are environmentally conscious.
