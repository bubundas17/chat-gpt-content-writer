The rise of the internet and the subsequent advancements in communication technologies have fundamentally changed the way we communicate with each other. From the early days of email and instant messaging to the latest social media platforms, the evolution of online communication has had a profound impact on how we use the internet today.

In this post, we'll take a closer look at the evolution of online communication, explore the technologies that have made it possible and examine the ways in which they have revolutionized the way we communicate on the web.

Early Days of Online Communication

The concept of online communication is nothing new. In fact, email has been around since the early days of the internet, with the first email messages being sent in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Instant messaging (IM) also came relatively early to the scene with platforms like ICQ and AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) being launched in the mid-1990s.

However, these early forms of online communication were limited in terms of functionality and accessibility. Email could only be sent and received by users who had access to the internet and an email address. Instant messaging platforms were also limited to users who had the same platform installed on their device.

The Rise of Social Media

It wasn't until the rise of social media that online communication really took off. Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn transformed the way we communicate online, making it more accessible, engaging, and interactive. Suddenly, online communication was no longer limited to email and IM, but instead, it was possible to communicate with friends, family, and colleagues in real-time regardless of where they were in the world.

Social media's impact on internet usage cannot be overstated. According to a study by GlobalWebIndex, the average person spends 2 hours and 24 minutes on social media every day. This is a significant amount of time and shows just how much social media has become an integral part of our daily lives.

Virtual Communication

Another key development in online communication has been the rise of virtual communication tools. Platforms like Zoom, Skype, and Google Meet have transformed the way we communicate with each other by making it possible to have real-time conversations, regardless of location. This has been particularly beneficial for remote workers and those working in global teams, allowing them to stay connected and work effectively regardless of where they are in the world.

Impact on Internet Usage

The impact of online communication on internet usage has been significant. According to a report by We Are Social, the average person spends 6 hours and 43 minutes online each day. Of this time, a significant proportion is spent on communication platforms like social media, email, and instant messaging.

The rise of online communication has also led to an increase in internet usage. In fact, the number of internet users worldwide has doubled since 2010, reaching a total of 4.9 billion in January 2022. This growth has been fuelled in part by the increase in online communication tools and platforms.

Conclusion

Overall, the evolution of online communication has had a profound impact on internet usage. From the early days of email and instant messaging to the latest social media platforms and virtual communication tools, online communication has transformed the way we communicate with each other. With this trend set to continue in the future, it's clear that online communication will remain a key driver of internet usage for the foreseeable future.
