LG CX supports Dolby Vision IQ, HDR10, and HLG HDR formats, which provide dynamic metadata and better color accuracy. It also has a Filmmaker Mode that preserves the original aspect ratio, color, and frame rate of movies. 

Sony A8H, on the other hand, uses X1 Ultimate processor, which can intelligently analyze and enhance any content in real-time. Sony A8H supports Dolby Vision, HDR10, and HLG HDR formats, which deliver more highlights and better shadow detail. It also has a Netflix Calibrated Mode that adjusts the picture settings to match the director's intent.
