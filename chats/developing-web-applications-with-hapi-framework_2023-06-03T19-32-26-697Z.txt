Hapi Framework is a powerful Node.js framework for building web applications. It is designed to be modular, extensible, and easy to use, making it a popular choice among developers. In this tutorial, we will walk you through the process of developing web applications with Hapi Framework.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into Hapi Framework, you should have basic knowledge of Node.js and JavaScript. You should also have Node.js and NPM (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. If you don't have Node.js and NPM installed, head to [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and install it.

## Installing Hapi Framework

The easiest way to install Hapi Framework is by using NPM. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm install hapi
```

This will install the latest version of Hapi Framework in your project.

## Building a Simple Web Application

To build a simple web application using Hapi Framework, create a new directory in your project and create a file named `index.js` in it. In this file, write the following code:

```javascript
const Hapi = require('hapi');
const server = Hapi.server({
    port: 3000,
    host: 'localhost'
});

server.route({
    method: 'GET',
    path: '/',
    handler: (request, h) => {
        return 'Hello World!';
    }
});

async function start() {
    await server.start();
    console.log(`Server running at: ${server.info.uri}`);
}

start();
```

In this code, we imported the `Hapi` module and created a new server object on port 3000. We also defined a route for the root path `/` and set the handler function to return a simple Hello World message. Finally, we started the server using the `start()` function.

Run the above code using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

Now, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see a "Hello World!" message displayed on the screen.

## Creating Dynamic Routes

Hapi Framework allows you to create dynamic routes by specifying parameters in the URL. For example, if you want to create a route that accepts a parameter `name` in the URL, you can do it like this:

```javascript
server.route({
    method: 'GET',
    path: '/hello/{name}',
    handler: (request, h) => {
        const { name } = request.params;
        return `Hello ${name}!`;
    }
});
```

In this code, we created a route with path `/hello/{name}` which accepts a parameter `name` in the URL. We then used the `request.params` object to get the value of the `name` parameter and returned a message with the parameter value.

## Static Files Serving

In real-world applications, you might need to serve static files such as CSS, JavaScript, and images. Hapi Framework makes it easy to serve static files using the `inert` plugin.

First, we need to install the `inert` plugin using NPM. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install inert
```

Now, we can use the plugin in our code like this:

```javascript
const Hapi = require('hapi');
const Path = require('path');
const Inert = require('inert');

const server = Hapi.server({
    port: 3000,
    host: 'localhost'
});

async function start() {
    try {
        await server.register(Inert);

        server.route({
            method: 'GET',
            path: '/{param*}',
            handler: {
                directory: {
                    path: Path.join(__dirname, 'public')
                }
            }
        });

        await server.start();
        console.log(`Server running at: ${server.info.uri}`);
    } catch (err) {
        console.error(err);
    }
}

start();
```

In this code, we imported the `Path` module and the `Inert` plugin. We then registered the `Inert` plugin with the server using `server.register()` function. We defined a route with path `/{param*}` to match all routes and used the `directory` handler to serve static files from the `public` directory.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to develop robust and scalable web applications using Hapi Framework. We covered everything from installation to deployment and everything in between. Hapi Framework is a powerful and easy-to-use framework for building web applications with Node.js. Now, you can use your knowledge to build your own web applications using Hapi Framework.
