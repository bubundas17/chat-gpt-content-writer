International conflicts are usually thought of as battles between military forces, where victory is defined as either conquest or cessation of hostilities. Rarely explored, however, is the devastating impact these conflicts have on the civilians who are caught in the crossfire. This investigative report uncovers the human rights violations that take place in international conflicts, revealing the truth behind the power politics that remain hidden from the public eye.

Human rights are a basic entitlement to all human beings - the right to life, liberty, and security. In times of conflict, however, these fundamental rights are often stripped away as the military forces of one country invade another. This is not only against international law but also a gross violation of human rights. As the number of violent conflicts around the world continues to rise, so do the cases of human rights violations.

One such case was the recent conflict in Syria, where both military forces and terrorist organizations have been accused of committing crimes against humanity. According to UN reports, chemical weapons and cluster bombs were used in areas densely populated by civilians. Syrian military forces also reportedly engaged in torture, rape, and enforced disappearance of suspected dissidents.

Another instance of human rights violations was the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, which saw numerous war crimes being committed by both American forces and their Iraqi counterparts. The infamous Abu Ghraib prison scandal, where US soldiers tortured and sexually abused detainees, is just one of the many examples of human rights violations in Iraq.

It's not just wars that lead to human rights violations, but also the use of extrajudicial killings and drone strikes. The US drone program has been criticized for its lack of transparency and accountability, with reports showing that civilian casualties have occurred in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia.

Investigative organizations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have been at the forefront of documenting and raising awareness of these human rights abuses. Their reports often call for accountability, investigations, and prosecutions of those responsible for such crimes. However, it is often difficult to bring perpetrators to justice, especially in times of conflict.

This article sheds light on what goes on during international conflicts and the human rights violations that often take place. It is a call to action to hold accountable those responsible for such abuses and to ensure that justice is seen to be done. After all, human rights are fundamental to our existence and must never be compromised by power politics.
