If you're familiar with Vue.js, you've probably used or heard about computed properties and methods. Both of these play an important role in Vue.js applications, but there are some important differences between them. In this article, we'll explore what computed properties are in Vue.js, how they differ from methods, and how to use them in your Vue.js applications.

### What are Computed Properties in Vue.js?

In Vue.js, computed properties are functions that are used to calculate a value based on other data properties in the Vue instance. Computed properties are cached based on the properties they depend on, and as a result, they will only re-evaluate when the related data properties change. This makes them very useful for optimizing performance when working with complex data or calculations.

Computed properties are defined directly on the component instance, and use the `computed` property definition. Here is an example of a computed property:

```javascript
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      firstName: 'John',
      lastName: 'Doe'
    };
  },
  computed: {
    fullName() {
      return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, the `fullName` computed property is dependent on the `firstName` and `lastName` data properties. Whenever either of these properties change, the `fullName` property will be re-evaluated.

### How do Computed Properties differ from Methods?

It's important to note that computed properties are different from methods in Vue.js. While computed properties are used to calculate a value based on other data properties, methods are used to perform operations and actions that can change the state of the component. Methods can be called from templates, computed properties, or even other methods.

Methods are defined using the `methods` property definition, while computed properties use the `computed` property definition. Here's an example of a method:

```javascript
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      count: 0
    };
  },
  computed: {
    isPositive() {
      return this.count > 0;
    }
  },
  methods: {
    increment() {
      this.count++;
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, the `increment` method changes the `count` data property, which then causes the `isPositive` computed property to be re-evaluated.

### When should you Use Computed Properties?

Computed properties are useful in a variety of scenarios in Vue.js applications. Here are some examples:

- **Displaying derived data:** Computed properties can be used to calculate and display derived data in templates. For example, you could use a computed property to calculate a user's age based on their birthdate.
- **Filtering or sorting data:** Computed properties can be used to filter or sort data based on certain criteria. For example, you could use a computed property to filter a list of items based on their status or category.
- **Performing expensive calculations:** Computed properties can be used to perform expensive calculations or operations, and return the result to the template. For example, you could use a computed property to calculate the total cost of items in a shopping cart.
- **Caching results:** Computed properties cache the results based on their dependencies, which can be used to improve performance in certain scenarios. For example, you could use a computed property to cache the result of a complex database query.

### Conclusion

Computed properties are an important feature in Vue.js, and can be used to optimize performance and simplify your code. By understanding the differences between computed properties and methods, you can choose the best approach for each scenario in your Vue.js applications.

In summary, computed properties are used for calculating a value based on other data properties, while methods are used for performing operations and actions. Computed properties are cached based on their dependencies and can be useful in scenarios such as displaying derived data, filtering or sorting data, performing expensive calculations, and caching results.We hope this article has helped you understand what computed properties are in Vue.js, and how they differ from methods. By using computed properties in your Vue.js applications, you can improve performance, simplify your code, and achieve better results.

If you want to learn more about Vue.js, there are many great resources available online, including official documentation, tutorials, examples, and forums. Keep practicing and honing your skills, and you'll be building amazing Vue.js applications in no time.
