Noise-canceling headphones have become an essential accessory for anyone looking to block out the noise and immerse themselves in their music, podcasts or audiobooks. Bose and Sony are two of the biggest manufacturers of noise-canceling headphones, with the Bose QuietComfort and Sony WH-1000XM3 being two of the most popular options on the market.

But, which one is the best? In this article, we’ll take you through a comprehensive comparison of the Bose QuietComfort and Sony WH-1000XM3 noise-canceling headphones. 

## Features

The Bose QuietComfort and Sony WH-1000XM3 share a lot of similar features, such as:

- Active noise canceling technology
- Touch controls on the ear cups
- Support for virtual assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant
- Bluetooth connectivity
- Long battery life

However, the Bose QuietComfort headphones have a couple of unique features including:

- Customizable noise cancelation settings via the Bose Connect app
- Audio prompts that inform you of your battery life and device connections

The Sony WH-1000XM3 also offers a few unique features including:

- The ability to adjust ambient sound settings with the Sony Headphones Connect app
- An auto-off feature that pauses audio playback when you take the headphones off your head

## Design and Comfort

Comfort is key when choosing a pair of noise-canceling headphones, especially if you plan to use them for extended periods. The Bose QuietComfort and Sony WH-1000XM3 both feature plush ear cups and a padded headband, which makes them comfortable to wear for long periods.

One big difference in design is the shape of the ear cups. The Sony WH-1000XM3 has a more oval shape, while the Bose QuietComfort headphones feature a circular shape. Both options provide ample coverage for most ears, but the Sony WH-1000XM3’s oval cups tend to fit around the ears better than the Bose QuietComfort. 

Additionally, the Bose QuietComfort headphones weigh 8.3 ounces, while the Sony WH-1000XM3 weighs 9 ounces. While this weight difference may not be a huge difference in the long run, it is worth noting if you're looking for a lighter pair of headphones.

## Audio Quality

The audio quality is perhaps the most crucial factor when choosing noise-canceling headphones. Both headphones have fantastic sound quality, but the Sony WH-1000XM3 takes the edge by offering more robust bass and a slightly wider soundstage. The Bose QuietComfort offers a more neutral sound than the Sony WH-1000XM3.

However, the Bose QuietComfort offers a unique feature that enables it to adjust audio EQ settings to cater to different listening preferences. For instance, when listening to hip-hop music, it automatically boosts the bass frequencies to make the music sound more lively.

## Battery Life

Battery life is a significant consideration when purchasing headphones. Both headphones offer excellent battery performance, with the Sony WH-1000XM3 delivering up to 30 hours of battery life compared to the Bose QuietComfort’s 20 hours. The 10 hour difference is noticeable, especially for frequent travelers.

## Pricing

The price difference between the two headphones is another consideration. The Bose QuietComfort is available at around $275, while the Sony WH-1000XM3 is priced around $350. The Bose QuietComfort appears to be slightly more affordable compared to the Sony WH-1000XM3.

## Verdict

Both the Bose QuietComfort and Sony WH-1000XM3 have strengths and weaknesses. The Bose QuietComfort headphones are relatively more affordable, with customizable noise cancelation, and audio EQ settings. However, the Sony WH-1000XM3 offers a better audio performance, a more fitting design, a longer battery life, and built-in ambient sound settings.

At the end of the day, it ultimately comes down to your preferences. If you're looking for a slightly more affordable, comfortable pair of headphones with customizable features, the Bose QuietComfort is an excellent option. If you prioritize superior audio quality, long battery life, and a more comfortable fit, Sony WH-1000XM3 is the choice for you.Which noise-canceling headphones you should choose between Bose QuietComfort and Sony WH-1000XM3 will depend on how you intend to use the headphones, personal preferences, and your budget. We hope this comparison can help you make an informed decision and choose the best headphones for your needs.
