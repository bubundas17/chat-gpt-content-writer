SSL Pinning and Public Key Pinning are two methods for strengthening the security of your website. They both involve using HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) to ensure that clients only communicate with servers that have the correct SSL/TLS certificate. However, there are some important differences between SSL Pinning and Public Key Pinning that you need to be aware of before deciding which method to use. In this post, we'll explain what SSL Pinning and Public Key Pinning are, how they work, and which one is right for your website's security.

## What is SSL Pinning?

SSL Pinning, also known as Certificate Pinning, involves hard-coding a specific SSL/TLS certificate or public key into a mobile app or web browser. This ensures that the app or browser only communicates with the server that has the exact certificate or public key that was hard-coded into it, rather than any other certificate that might be signed by the same CA.

In other words, SSL Pinning is a way to prevent man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks that involve attackers presenting fake SSL/TLS certificates. By hard-coding a specific certificate or public key, you can prevent an attacker from using a fake certificate to intercept traffic between the client and the server.

## What is Public Key Pinning?

Public Key Pinning, also known as HPKP, involves sending a HTTP header to the client that contains a list of public keys or SSL/TLS certificate fingerprints that are allowed for the website. The client then caches this list and uses it to verify the authenticity of the SSL/TLS certificate presented by the server during subsequent visits.

Like SSL Pinning, Public Key Pinning helps prevent MitM attacks by ensuring that the client only communicates with servers that have the correct SSL/TLS certificate. However, Public Key Pinning is more flexible than SSL Pinning because it allows you to specify multiple public keys or certificates, rather than just one.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of SSL Pinning

Advantages:

- SSL Pinning provides a high level of security against MitM attacks.
- SSL Pinning is relatively easy to implement.
- SSL Pinning is ideal for apps that communicate with a single server.
- SSL Pinning can be used in conjunction with Public Key Pinning for even greater security.

Disadvantages:

- SSL Pinning can be difficult to manage if you have many servers or if the SSL/TLS certificate must be frequently updated.
- SSL Pinning can create problems for users who connect to your app or website from multiple devices or locations.
- SSL Pinning can cause additional overhead and latency because the client must verify the SSL/TLS certificate every time it connects to the server.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Public Key Pinning

Advantages:

- Public Key Pinning provides high security against MitM attacks.
- Public Key Pinning is more flexible than SSL Pinning because it allows you to specify multiple public keys or certificates.
- Public Key Pinning can be managed centrally and can be quickly updated if an SSL/TLS certificate is compromised.
- Public Key Pinning can be used with subdomains or multiple servers.

Disadvantages:

- Public Key Pinning can be complicated to implement.
- Public Key Pinning requires an HTTP header to be sent with every response, which can add overhead and latency to your website.
- Public Key Pinning can be difficult to manage if you have a large number of domain names or subdomains.

## Which One is Right for Your Website?

The choice between SSL Pinning and Public Key Pinning ultimately depends on your website's specific needs. If your app or website communicates with a single server, SSL Pinning is a good choice. However, if you have multiple subdomains or servers, or if you need more flexibility in managing your SSL/TLS certificates, Public Key Pinning is probably the better choice.

It's also worth noting that both SSL Pinning and Public Key Pinning can be combined for even stronger security. By using both methods together, you can provide your website with the highest level of protection against MitM attacks.

In conclusion, the decision between SSL Pinning and Public Key Pinning requires careful evaluation of your website's specific security needs. Both methods can provide a high level of protection, but the advantages and disadvantages of each should be carefully considered before making a decision. Whatever method you choose, make sure that your website is protected by a valid SSL/TLS certificate and that your website's security is regularly audited and updated.In the end, it's better to take some extra time to decide which method is best for your website, rather than ignoring security needs altogether.  All the website owners should be more serious about security breaches and implement techniques like SSL pinning, Public key pinning, and many more to protect their customers' sensitive information and reputation. From this post, you learned about the differences between SSL pinning and Public key pinning, their advantages and disadvantages, factors that influence the choice of one over the other, and how to use both methods simultaneously to provide your website with the maximum level of protection against attack. Now, it's time for you to evaluate your website's security needs and take the necessary steps to implement SSL pinning and Public key pinning's right security technique.
