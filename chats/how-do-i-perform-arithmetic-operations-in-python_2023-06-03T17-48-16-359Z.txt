TOPIC: How do I perform arithmetic operations in Python

TITLE: Guide to Arithmetic Operations in Python
META_DESCRIPTION: Learn how to perform arithmetic operations in Python with this comprehensive guide. From basic addition and subtraction to more complex operations like modulo and exponentiation, we cover it all.

Python is a popular and powerful programming language, widely used for everything from web development to data science. One of the fundamentals of programming is being able to perform arithmetic operations, and in this guide, you'll learn how to do that in Python.

## Numbers in Python
Before we dive into the arithmetic operators, it's important to understand how numbers are represented in Python. There are two main types of numbers in Python: integers and floating-point numbers (also known as floats).

Integers are whole numbers (positive, negative or zero) with no decimal places.
```python
x = 4 # integer
y = -7 # negative integer
```

Floating-point numbers are numbers with decimal places, which can be represented with a decimal point or scientific notation.
```python
x = 3.14 # float
y = 2.5e-3 # scientific notation (0.0025)
```

## Arithmetic Operators

Python has several arithmetic operators for performing basic mathematical calculations. These operators work with both integers and floating-point numbers.

### Addition
The `+` operator is used for addition.
```python
x = 4
y = 6
z = x + y # 10
```

### Subtraction
The `-` operator is used for subtraction.
```python
x = 10
y = 2
z = x - y # 8
```

### Multiplication
The `*` operator is used for multiplication.
```python
x = 6
y = 3
z = x * y # 18
```

### Division
The `/` operator is used for division. In Python 3.x, division of two integers results in a floating-point number, even if the result is a whole number.
```python
x = 9
y = 3
z = x / y # 3.0
```
In Python 2.x, the same operation would result in an integer if both operands were integers, and a floating-point number otherwise.

### Floor Division
The `//` operator is used for floor division, which returns the largest integer less than or equal to the result of the division.
```python
x = 7
y = 2
z = x // y # 3
```

### Modulo
The `%` operator is used for modulo, which returns the remainder of the division.
```python
x = 7
y = 2
z = x % y # 1
```

### Exponentiation
The `**` operator is used for exponentiation, which raises the left operand to the power of the right operand.
```python
x = 2
y = 3
z = x ** y # 8
```

## Order of Operations
Just like in standard mathematical notation, the order of operations in Python follows the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction). 

### Parentheses
Use parentheses to group terms and perform operations within the innermost set of parentheses first.
```python
x = 5
y = 10
z = (x + y) * 2 # 30
```

### Exponents
Next, perform any exponents from left to right.
```python
x = 2
y = 3
z = x ** y + 1 # 9
```

### Multiplication and Division
Then, perform any multiplication or division from left to right.
```python
x = 6
y = 3
z = x + y * 2 - 1 # 10
```

### Addition and Subtraction
Finally, perform any addition or subtraction from left to right.
```python
x = 5
y = 3
z = x * y - 2 + 1 # 13
```

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we have covered the arithmetic operators in Python, how to perform basic mathematical calculations, and the order of operations. With these fundamentals, you will be able to perform a wide range of mathematical calculations in Python.I hope this guide has helped you grasp the basics of performing arithmetic operations in Python. Remember that Python has many other operators and functions for more complex calculations and math operations, so don't hesitate to explore and experiment on your own as you continue to develop your Python skills.
