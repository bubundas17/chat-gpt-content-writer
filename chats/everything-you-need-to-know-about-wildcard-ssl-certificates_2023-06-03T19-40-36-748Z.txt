If you have a website with several subdomains and want to secure them all with HTTPS encryption, a Wildcard SSL certificate might be what you need. 

In this post, we’ll explore what wildcard SSL certificates are, their benefits and drawbacks, and how to use them to secure multiple subdomains efficiently and cost-effectively.

## What Is a Wildcard SSL Certificate?

A wildcard SSL certificate secures a domain and any of its subdomains. It uses an asterisk (*) as a placeholder in the domain name to cover unlimited subdomains at one level. For example, if you purchase a Wildcard SSL certificate for *.example.com, it covers blog.example.com, store.example.com, and any other subdomains at the same level, but not sub.subdomain.example.com.

## Benefits of Using a Wildcard SSL Certificate

Using a single Wildcard SSL certificate can provide several advantages, including:

### Cost-Effective

Wildcard SSL certificates are a cost-effective solution for organizations that run several subdomains and want to secure them all with HTTPS. Instead of purchasing multiple SSL certificates for each subdomain, you can secure all of them with a single Wildcard SSL certificate.

### Manageability

When you have a lot of subdomains, it can be challenging to manage multiple SSL certificates. With Wildcard SSL, you only need to manage one certificate to secure all your subdomains.

### Versatility

Wildcard SSL certificates can secure any domain and its subdomains. It’s not limited to a specific set of subdomains, making it versatile for organizations that add new subdomains frequently.

### Simplifying the Certificate Renewal Process

With a single Wildcard SSL certificate, certificate renewal can be simplified and less time-consuming.

## Drawbacks of Using a Wildcard SSL Certificate

While wildcard SSL certificates offer benefits, they can also have some drawbacks:

### Security Limitations

Using only one certificate to secure multiple subdomains might seem like a more efficient approach. However, it can also be more risky if one subdomain gets compromised, hackers could gain access to all subdomains protected by the same certificate. 

### Complexity

Wildcard SSL certificates can be harder to manage than standard SSL certificates. That’s because it requires maintaining and securing only one certificate and key, while at the same time protecting unlimited subdomains.

### Limited Coverage

It’ important to understand that Wildcard SSL certificates only cover subdomains at one level. The certificate won’t secure sub-subdomains, such as sub.subdomain.example.com. If you have unique subdomains at multiple levels, you’ll need to purchase multiple Wildcard SSL certificates.

## How to Use Wildcard SSL Certificates

Using Wildcard SSL certificates to secure your subdomains is a straightforward process. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Identify the main domain name and all the subdomains you want to protect.
2. Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for the Wildcard SSL certificate.
3. Purchase a Wildcard SSL certificate from a trusted certificate authority.
4. Install the certificate on the server that hosts the main domain.
5. Configure your server to recognize the certificate on all subdomains.

## Conclusion

Wildcard SSL certificates can be an excellent solution for organizations that run several subdomains and want to secure them all with HTTPS encryption. While there are some drawbacks to using a Wildcard SSL certificate, the benefits outweigh them. Knowing what they are and how to use them can benefit your website and online security.In conclusion, Wildcard SSL certificates offer a cost-effective way to secure multiple subdomains efficiently. With one certificate, you can secure unlimited subdomains at one level rather than purchasing multiple certificates for each subdomain, which can be time-consuming and expensive.

However, it's essential to understand the limitations and potential security risks of using Wildcard SSL certificates. If one subdomain is compromised, all subdomains protected by the same certificate are at risk. Additionally, Wildcard SSL certificates only cover subdomains at one level, so if you have sub-subdomains, you'll need to purchase additional certificates.

Despite these drawbacks, Wildcard SSL certificates remain a popular choice for organizations that need to secure several subdomains cost-effectively and efficiently. As you plan your website security strategy, consider exploring Wildcard SSL certificates to see if they're the right solution for you.
