# Configuring Replication in PostgreSQL: Step-by-Step Guide

When you are working with databases, especially in a production environment, it is essential to have a way to ensure high availability and disaster recovery. Replication is an effective solution to achieve both of these goals, and PostgreSQL offers two types of replication â€“ asynchronous and synchronous.

In this article, we will walk you through the process of configuring replication in PostgreSQL, including setting up both asynchronous and synchronous replication, with step-by-step instructions and examples.

## Prerequisites

Before we start configuring replication in PostgreSQL, make sure you have the following:

- Two or more PostgreSQL servers running on different machines
- Access to the PostgreSQL configuration files on each server
- Knowledge of PostgreSQL configuration parameters

## Enabling Replication in PostgreSQL

### Step 1: Enable PostgreSQL on the Primary Server

To enable replication in PostgreSQL, you must first modify the primary server's configuration file to allow replication. Open the `postgresql.conf` file on the primary server's machine and add the following parameters:

```
wal_level = replica
max_wal_senders = 10
wal_keep_segments = 10
```

The `wal_level` parameter should be set to "replica" to enable the server to create WAL records that are required for replication. 

The `max_wal_senders` parameter determines the maximum number of concurrent streaming replication connections on the primary server. 

The `wal_keep_segments` parameter specifies the number of WAL segments to keep on the primary server even after they have been sent to the standby server.

Once you have added these parameters, save the `postgresql.conf` file and restart the primary server to apply the changes.

### Step 2: Configure Access to the Standby Server

The standby server is the server that receives data from the primary server during replication. In PostgreSQL, replication can be asynchronous or synchronous, and to enable replication between the primary and standby servers, the standby server needs to be configured to allow access from the primary server.

To allow access to the standby server, open the `pg_hba.conf` file on the standby server's machine and add the following line to the file:

```
host    replication     <primary_server_ip>/32   trust
```

Replace `<primary_server_ip>` with the actual IP address of the primary server. This line allows the primary server to connect to the standby server for replication with no password authentication.

Once you have added this line, save the `pg_hba.conf` file and restart the standby server to apply the changes.

### Step 3: Start the Replication Process

Now that you have enabled replication in the primary server and configured the standby server to allow access, you can start the replication process.

On the primary server, run the following command in the PostgreSQL command prompt:

```
SELECT * FROM pg_create_physical_replication_slot('<slot_name>');
```

Replace `<slot_name>` with the name of the replication slot that you want to create on the primary server.

This command creates a logical slot on the primary server and allocates the necessary resources to write WAL records to the slot.

On the standby server, edit the `postgresql.conf` file and add the following parameters:

```
primary_conninfo = 'host=<primary_server_ip> port=5432 user=<replication_username>'
primary_slot_name = '<slot_name>'
```

Replace `<primary_server_ip>` with the IP address of the primary server, `<replication_username>` with a valid PostgreSQL user name for replication, and `<slot_name>` with the name of the replication slot that you created on the primary server.

These parameters instruct the standby server to connect to the primary server and subscribe to the replication slot when the server starts up.

Once you have added these parameters, save the `postgresql.conf` file, and start the server.

## Synchronous Replication in PostgreSQL

Asynchronous replication is the default replication mode in PostgreSQL, meaning that the primary server does not wait for the standby server to confirm that it has received and written the WAL records before committing the changes.

Synchronous replication, on the other hand, requires the primary server to receive acknowledgment from the standby server before committing the changes. This mode guarantees that data loss is minimal in case of a primary server failure.

To enable synchronous replication in PostgreSQL, follow these additional steps after enabling replication and starting the replication process as outlined above:

1. On the primary server, edit the `postgresql.conf` file and enable synchronous replication by setting the following parameter:

```
synchronous_commit = on
```

This parameter makes sure that changes are only committed to the primary server after the standby servers confirm that they have received and written the WAL records.

2. On the standby server, edit the `postgresql.conf` file, and set the following parameter:

```
synchronous_standby_names = '<num_sync_standbys> (<standby_name>)'
```

Replace `<num_sync_standbys>` with the total number of synchronous standby servers replicated, and `<standby_name>` with the name of the standby server.

These parameters ensure that the standby server receives changes synchronously from the primary server.

## Failover in PostgreSQL

Failover is the process of transitioning from the primary server to the standby server in case of a primary server failure.

During failover, the standby server must be promoted to become the new primary server, and the original primary server becomes the new standby server.

To perform failover in PostgreSQL, follow these steps:

1. Stop the original primary server, and promote the standby server to become the new primary server.

2. On the new primary server, edit the `postgresql.conf` file, and change the `primary_conninfo` parameter to point to the old standby server's IP address.

3. Start the old primary server, and edit the `postgresql.conf` file to allow replication from the new primary server as described in steps 2 and 3.

4. Restart the old primary server; it should now start as a new standby server.

## Conclusion

Configuring replication in PostgreSQL is a straightforward process, but it requires some awareness of PostgreSQL configuration parameters and the underlying network infrastructure. Asynchronous replication is generally sufficient for most situations, but synchronous replication provides data redundancy and minimal downtime in case of a primary server failure. 

Use these step-by-step instructions to set up replication in PostgreSQL, apply synchronous replication, and perform failover to safeguard your database and maintain high availability.We hope this guide was helpful in configuring replication in PostgreSQL. Remember to test your replication setup thoroughly before using it in production.
