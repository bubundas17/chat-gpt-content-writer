TOPIC: What are the built-in data structures in Python

TITLE: Python Built-in Data Structures: A Comprehensive Overview
META_DESCRIPTION: Dive into the core of Python programming language by learning about its built-in data structures, including lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.

Python is a high-level programming language that is widely used for a variety of applications, including data science, web development, and artificial intelligence. One of the key components of Python is its built-in data structures, which allow developers to efficiently store and manipulate data. In this article, we will explore the most commonly used Python data structures and how to use them in your code.

### Lists

Lists are the most commonly used Python data structure. They are used to store an ordered collection of items, which can be of different data types, such as integers, strings, and even other lists. In Python, lists are defined using square brackets. Here's a simple example:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, "apple", "orange", [4, 5, 6]]
```

You can access individual elements of a list using their index, which starts at 0. For example, to access the first element of `my_list`, you would use `my_list[0]`.

Lists are mutable, which means you can change their elements after they are created. You can add new elements to a list using the `append()` method:

```python
my_list.append(7)
```

You can also remove elements from a list using the `remove()` method:

```python
my_list.remove("orange")
```

### Tuples

Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable, which means you cannot change their elements after they are created. In Python, tuples are defined using parentheses. Here's an example of how to create a tuple:

```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, "apple", "orange")
```

Because tuples are immutable, they are faster and consume less memory than lists, which makes them a good choice for storing data that should not be modified.

### Sets

A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. In Python, sets are defined using curly braces or by calling the `set()` function. Here's an example:

```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3, "apple", "orange"}
```

You can add elements to a set using the `add()` method:

```python
my_set.add("banana")
```

You can remove elements from a set using the `remove()` method:

```python
my_set.remove("orange")
```

### Dictionaries

A dictionary, also known as a map or associative array, is a collection of key-value pairs. In Python, dictionaries are defined using curly braces and colons to separate the keys from the values. Here's an example:

```python
my_dict = {"apple": 1, "orange": 2, "banana": 3}
```

You can access values in a dictionary using their keys:

```python
my_dict["apple"]   # returns 1
```

You can add new key-value pairs to a dictionary using the square bracket notation:

```python
my_dict["pear"] = 4
```

You can remove key-value pairs from a dictionary using the `del` keyword:

```python
del my_dict["banana"]
```

### Collections Module

In addition to the built-in data structures, Python's standard library also includes a module called `collections` that provides additional data structures. Some of the most commonly used collections are:

- `Counter`: A collection that counts the frequency of elements in a list.
- `Deque`: A double-ended queue that supports adding and removing elements from both ends.
- `OrderedDict`: A dictionary that remembers the insertion order of its keys.

To use the `collections` module, you must import it at the beginning of your code:

```python
from collections import Counter, deque, OrderedDict
```

### Conclusion

Python's built-in data structures provide a powerful and flexible way to store and manipulate data in your code. By understanding how to use lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, and the collections module, you'll be able to write more efficient and effective code. Happy coding!
