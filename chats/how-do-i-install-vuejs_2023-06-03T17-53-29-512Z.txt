Vue.js is a popular open-source JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications. It has gained immense popularity among web developers due to its simplicity and scalability. Installing Vue.js on your computer is a straightforward process. In this beginner's guide, we will walk you through the steps for installing Vue.js on your system.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Installing Vue.js
Before we start, make sure that your system has Node.js installed. If not, visit [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and download the latest version that's compatible with your operating system. 

### Step 1: Open Your Command Line Interface (CLI)
To start the installation process, open your CLI. On Windows, press `Win + R` on your keyboard, type in `cmd`, and hit Enter. On a Mac, open the Terminal app by searching for it in Spotlight or navigating to `Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app`.

### Step 2: Install Vue.js Using npm
Once you have your CLI up and running, it's time to install Vue.js using the package manager npm. To install Vue.js globally, enter the following command: 

```
npm install -g vue
```

### Step 3: Verify Vue.js Installation
To verify whether Vue.js is installed on your system, enter the following command in your CLI:

```
vue --version
```

If you have followed the above steps correctly, you should see the version number of Vue.js installed on your system displayed in the CLI.

### Step 4: Create Your First Vue.js Project
Congratulations! You have successfully installed Vue.js. Now, let's create your first Vue.js project. To create a new Vue.js project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.
2. Enter the following command:

```
vue create <project-name>
```
 
In place of `<project-name>`, enter the name you want for your project.

3. Once the installation process is complete, navigate to your project directory using the following command:

```
cd <project-name>
```

### Step 5: Start Your Vue.js Project
To run your project, enter the following command:

```
npm run serve
```

Once the server is up and running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`. You should see the default Vue.js landing page, and your first Vue.js project is now up and running.

## Wrapping Up
That's all it takes to install Vue.js on your computer and create your first project using this fantastic framework. Always ensure you have the latest version of Vue.js installed on your system to get the most out of it. If you encounter any issues while installing Vue.js, ensure that you follow the above steps correctly and check the documentation available on the [official Vue.js website](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html).
