Step 1: Understanding the Importance of Updating WordPress Plugins
Updating WordPress plugins is critical for two main reasons. One, you get to enjoy the new features, improvements, and enhancements that come with the updates. Additionally, plugins are updated to patch security vulnerabilities; thus, updating them ensures your website stays secure from potential attacks.

To manage and update your WordPress plugins, you first need to access the installed plugins. To do that, log in to your WordPress dashboard, and from the menu on the left, click "Plugins." Here, you will see all the plugins currently active on your website.

Step 3: Check and Update Plugins
To check for updates, you need to click on "Updates Available" on the Plugin page. You will see all the plugins that have updates available and the version currently installed. To update each plugin, check the box to select it, and click "Update Plugins."

Step 4: Updating Plugins Individually
Alternatively, you can update individual plugins by hovering your mouse over the plugin name and click "Update Now."

Step 5: Automatic Plugin Updates
Updating each plugin manually can be time-consuming, especially if you have many plugins. You can automate the update process by installing and activating "Easy Updates Manager" plugin. This plugin offers different options for automatic updates, such as core updates, theme updates, plugin updates, and translation updates.

Step 6: Deleting Unused Plugins
It is essential to keep your website lean by deleting unused and inactive plugins. To delete a plugin, go to the Plugin page, locate the plugin you want to delete, and click "Deactivate." After deactivating, click "Delete" to remove the plugin entirely from your website.

Step 7: Update Plugins Regularly
It is critical to keep updating your plugins, whether automatically or manually, to enjoy new features, performance improvements, and security patches. Aim to update them at least every two weeks or whenever prompted to update them.
