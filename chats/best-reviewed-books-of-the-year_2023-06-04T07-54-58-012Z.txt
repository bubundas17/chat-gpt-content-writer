In a year where we all craved for escapism, books proved to be a refuge. Literature has always been a source of comfort and enlightenment but this year, it has also been a source of entertainment. From exploring new cultures to discovering new ideas, there have been books for every taste and preference. As the year draws to a close, it is time to look back on the best reviewed books of the year.

Here is a list of books that have garnered critical acclaim and top ratings from readers:

2. American Dirt by Jeanine Cummins- This controversial work of fiction caused waves of discussion over issues of authenticity, representation, and creative license. Despite the controversy, the book was widely praised for its gripping and heart-wrenching story. 

3. A Promised Land by Barack Obama - The memoir of the 44th President of the United States. A Promised Land has been praised for its intimate and insightful reflections on his presidency and the challenges the country faced during his tenure.

4. Caste by Isabel Wilkerson - A work of non-fiction that explores the impact of social hierarchy in America. The book has drawn comparisons with "The New Jim Crow" and has been acclaimed for its in-depth analysis and powerful storytelling.

5. Homie by Danez Smith - This collection of poems has been lauded for its emotional depth and social commentary. The poems in Homie explore themes of friendship, masculinity, and race, making it a timely and important work of literature.

6. Interior Chinatown by Charles Yu - A satirical novel that tackles issues of representation in media and the entertainment industry. The book has been widely praised for its inventive and entertaining approach to a serious issue.

7. The City We Became by N. K. Jemisin - A science fiction novel that explores the idea of a city coming to life. Jemisin has been called one of the most illustrious voices in speculative fiction, and this book is a prime example of her talent.

These are just a few of the best-rated books of the year. The list is by no means exhaustive, and there are plenty of other books that have received critical acclaim. Regardless of your preferred genre or writing style, this year had something for everyone. 

In conclusion, as the year comes to an end, it is important to note the immense value of literature in our lives.
