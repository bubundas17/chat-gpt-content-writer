In recent years, pet ownership has become increasingly popular across the world. In fact, according to the American Pet Products Association (APPA), 67% of US households own a pet, which equates to 84.9 million homes. The trend is similar in other countries, such as the UK where it is estimated that roughly 45% of households own a pet. Moreover, the pet industry has boomed and continues to grow, with a projected global value of $269 billion by 2025. In this blog post, we explore the latest trends in pet ownership and the pet industry, as well as shed light on insights from industry experts.

Dogs and cats remain the most popular pets, with dogs being the most owned pet in the US with 63.4 million households owning one or more dogs. Cats are the second most popular pet, with 42.7 million households owning them. Both cats and dogs are considered family members and the pet industry has responded with a plethora of offerings including high-end pet foods, accessories, and pet services like grooming, dog walking and pet hotels. Millennials are playing a significant role in the pet industry boom, with this demographic owning the largest share (35%) of pets. This generation's love for pets has fueled the growth of specialty pet food and services which tend to be more expensive than mainstream offerings.

Another trend that's emerging is the rise of exotic pets. In recent years, we've seen more people owning hedgehogs, reptiles, ferrets, and even pot-bellied pigs. This trend is likely due to the popularity of online videos and social media showcasing these pets in videos and posts. However, many experts are concerned about the well-being of these animals since they require specific care and environments that may not be provided by owners.

The interest in pet ownership has also had an impact on home buying and renting. Recent studies have shown more pet owners are prioritizing finding pet-friendly housing. Many pet owners prefer apartments or homes with backyards to ensure their pets have plenty of room to play. To cater to these pet owners, real estate developers have introduced animal-centric amenities such as dog runs, rooftop dog parks, and doggie spas.

The pandemic has only intensified the trend of pet ownership, with many people adopting pets to cope with isolation and loneliness. In fact, according to the APPA, there was an increase in pet ownership during the pandemic. Despite many people returning to work and normal routines, pet adoption remains strong as more people realize the benefits of pet ownership.

From these insights, it's clear the trend towards pet ownership is on the rise, with dogs and cats remaining the most popular pets. The pet industry is booming and evolving to meet pet owners' demands for high-end services and products. However, as with any trend, it is essential to ensure that the well-being of animals remains at the forefront. With the continued growth of the pet industry comes more responsibility to provide pets with care, nutrition, and living environments that meet their needs.In conclusion, pet ownership is a growing trend with no signs of slowing down. From dogs and cats to exotic pets, there is a pet for every lifestyle. The pet industry is booming and evolving to cater to the needs of pet owners, providing high-end services, and specialized products. With the rising demand for pet-friendly housing and the pandemic driving pet adoption rates up, we can expect pet ownership to continue to grow in popularity. It's an exciting time for the pet industry, but it is essential to ensure that we prioritize the welfare of our furry, scaled, or feathered friends.
