Are you tired of weak vacuum suction that doesn't pick up all the dirt and debris on your floors? Two popular brands that are known for their strong suction are Dyson and Shark. In this post, we'll compare the suction power of these two brands and help you decide which one is best for your cleaning needs.

## Dyson: A Pioneer in Suction Technology

Dyson is a British company founded by Sir James Dyson in 1991. The company is known for its innovative designs and use of cyclonic technology in its vacuum cleaners. Cyclonic technology uses centrifugal force to separate dust and debris from the air, preventing clogs and maintaining constant suction power.

Dyson offers a range of vacuum cleaners, including upright, canister, stick, and handheld models. The brand's most powerful vacuum cleaner is the Dyson Ball Animal 2, which boasts a suction power of 306 AW (air watts). This model also comes with a range of accessories and attachments for cleaning pet hair, stairs, and upholstery.

## Shark: A Powerful Challenger

Shark is a US-based company that has been making vacuum cleaners since 1998. The brand is known for its lightweight and versatile designs, as well as its use of advanced filtration technology to trap allergens and dust particles.

Shark offers a range of vacuum cleaners, including upright, canister, stick, and handheld models. The brand's most powerful vacuum cleaner is the Shark Apex DuoClean with Zero-M, which boasts a suction power of 270 AW. This model also comes with a range of accessories and attachments, including a motorized brush and crevice tool for cleaning tight spaces.

## Comparison: Dyson vs Shark

When it comes to suction power, Dyson has the edge over Shark. The Dyson Ball Animal 2 boasts a higher suction power of 306 AW, compared to the Shark Apex DuoClean with Zero-M's 270 AW. However, both brands offer a range of accessories and attachments to customize your cleaning experience.

In terms of price, Dyson vacuum cleaners tend to be more expensive than Shark vacuum cleaners. The Dyson Ball Animal 2 typically retails for around $500, while the Shark Apex DuoClean with Zero-M is priced at around $350. However, both brands offer warranties and customer support to ensure your vacuum cleaner lasts for years.

## Conclusion

In summary, if suction power is your top priority and you're willing to pay a premium for it, Dyson is the brand for you. However, if you're looking for a more affordable option that still offers strong suction and versatile cleaning options, Shark is a great choice. Ultimately, the best vacuum cleaner for you depends on your cleaning needs and budget.
