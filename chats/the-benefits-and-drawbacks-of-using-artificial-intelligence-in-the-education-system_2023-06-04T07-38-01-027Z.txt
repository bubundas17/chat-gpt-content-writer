With these insights, teachers can adjust their teaching strategies to achieve better outcomes. The data collected can serve as an evaluation mechanism to analyze the effectiveness of different teaching methods and assess individual student performance. This enables teachers to act proactively, identify and help students who may need additional support.

## Drawbacks of Using Artificial Intelligence in Education

1. Privacy and Security Risks

AI technology often relies on the collection of vast amounts of personal data on students, including academic performance, behavior, and other personal information. This creates privacy and security risks, as this data could potentially be hacked, stolen, or abused. By allowing AI technology to be an integral part of the education sector, it is important to ensure that school's cybersecurity measures are robust, and confidentiality and privacy is taken into account.

2. Lack of Human Interaction

AI-based learning systems cannot replace human interaction in the learning process. The importance of social interaction has been acknowledged as trainers of key policies in the education domain, students have to develop their social skills, connectivity, debate, and interaction with peers and teachers. Social and emotional learning skills, critical thinking and creativity depend on human interactions. It is critical to ensure these vital human interactions remain intact while improving the education system.

3. Bias and Discrimination 

AI technology has been criticized for being biased or discriminatory towards certain demographics. This presents a risk that AI systems could perpetuate inequalities and discrimination in educational pathways. Incorrect or inadequate data learning training can lead to AI learning abilities also taking on the biases and prejudices of the people who input database algorithms and trigger ethical biases and create discrimination towards a particular set of students.
