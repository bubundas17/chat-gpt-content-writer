Robotic vacuum cleaners have become increasingly popular over the years. Not only do they save time and energy, but they also make cleaning more efficient and effective. However, not all robotic vacuum cleaners are created equal, especially when it comes to dealing with pet hair. In this post, we will compare two of the best robotic vacuum cleaners for pet hair removal: the Roomba i7 and the Shark IQ Robot. 

### Roomba i7

The Roomba i7 is a high-end robotic vacuum cleaner that comes with several advanced features aimed at making pet hair removal a breeze. One of the standout features of the Roomba i7 is the iAdapt 3.0 Navigation with vSLAM technology, which helps the vacuum cleaner to navigate and map your home accurately. This makes it easier for the Roomba i7 to clean up pet hair and other debris in hard-to-reach areas, such as under the bed, couch, and other furniture.

The Roomba i7 also comes with a high-efficiency filter that captures 99% of pet hair, dander, and allergens as small as 10 microns. This makes it an ideal choice for households with allergy sufferers. Additionally, the Roomba i7 has a high suction power of 1700Pa, which is important when it comes to removing pet hair and debris from carpets and hard floors.

Another feature that makes the Roomba i7 a great robotic vacuum cleaner for pet hair removal is the Clean Base Automatic Dirt Disposal. This feature allows the Roomba i7 to empty itself for up to 60 days, making it an ideal choice for pet owners who cannot empty their vacuum cleaners regularly.

### Shark IQ Robot

The Shark IQ Robot is another popular robotic vacuum cleaner that boasts several features aimed at making pet hair removal easy. Like the Roomba i7, the Shark IQ Robot has a high suction power of 1700Pa, making it ideal for removing pet hair and debris from carpets and floors. 

One of the standout features of the Shark IQ Robot is the Self-Emptying Base, which allows the vacuum cleaner to empty itself for up to 30 days. While this is not as long as the Roomba i7, it is still a useful feature for pet owners who want to avoid emptying their vacuum cleaners regularly.

The Shark IQ Robot also has a HEPA filter that captures 99% of pet hair, dander, and allergens as small as 0.3 microns. This makes it an excellent choice for households with allergy sufferers. Additionally, the Shark IQ Robot has a multi-surface brush roll that can tackle pet hair on carpets and hard floors.

### Comparison: Roomba i7 vs Shark IQ Robot

Now that we have looked at the features of the Roomba i7 and the Shark IQ Robot let's compare the two robotic vacuum cleaners to see which one is best for pet hair removal.

- Navigation: The Roomba i7 has the vSLAM technology, which helps it navigate better compared to the Shark IQ Robot. This is particularly useful for pet owners who want to ensure that hard-to-reach areas are clean. 

- Filtration: Both robotic vacuum cleaners have HEPA filters that capture pet hair, dander, and allergens. However, the Roomba i7 captures particles as small as 10 microns, while the Shark IQ Robot captures particles as small as 0.3 microns. This makes the Shark IQ Robot slightly better at capturing allergens such as pet hair and dander.

- Self-Emptying Base: The Roomba i7 has a self-emptying base that can empty itself for up to 60 days, while the Shark IQ Robot can empty itself for only 30 days. This means that the Roomba i7 requires less maintenance compared to the Shark IQ Robot.

- Suction power: Both robotic vacuum cleaners have a high suction power of 1700Pa, making them equally effective at removing pet hair and debris from carpets and floors.

### Conclusion

Firstly, it has better navigation capabilities, which makes it more effective in picking up pet hair and debris. Secondly, the Roomba i7 captures particles as small as 10 microns, which is perfect for households with allergy sufferers. Lastly, the Roomba i7 has a self-emptying base that can empty itself for up to 60 days, reducing the need for regular maintenance. 

If you are looking for a robotic vacuum cleaner that can handle pet hair removal efficiently, the Roomba i7 is definitely worth considering. However, if you are on a budget and still want a good quality robotic vacuum cleaner, the Shark IQ Robot is a formidable alternative.Overall, both the Roomba i7 and the Shark IQ Robot have unique features that make them exceptional for pet hair removal. When choosing between the two, it is essential to consider your specific needs and the features that matter most. Itâ€™s also important to consider your budget as the Roomba i7 is more expensive than the Shark IQ Robot. No matter which one you choose, both robotic vacuum cleaners are a great investment as they save time and energy while keeping your home clean and free of pet hair and other debris.
