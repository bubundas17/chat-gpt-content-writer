Regular expressions, commonly known as "regex," are a powerful tool for manipulating text data. Whether you want to match specific patterns in text data or replace parts of it, regex can handle various complexities involving string processing. Python comes equipped with a built-in regex library called `re`, which makes working with regular expressions even more manageable.

In this tutorial, we will cover everything you need to know about regular expressions in Python. We will start with some basic concepts and move towards advanced topics like greedy matching, non-greedy matching, lookahead, and lookbehind. Follow along, and you will master regular expressions in no time.

## What are Regular Expressions? 

Regular expressions are a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. They are used for matching strings or parts of strings, validating input data, and replacing text. A regular expression, also known as regex, is a pattern that is used to match a specific character or group of characters in a string.

## Basic Concepts of Regular Expressions 

Before diving into advanced concepts, let's understand some basic building blocks of regular expressions in Python.

### Literal Characters 

Literal characters are those that match the exact same characters in a string. For example, the regex pattern `abc` will match the string `abc`. 

### Character Classes 

A character class is used to match any one of a predefined set of characters. For example, the regex pattern `[abc]` will match either `a`, `b`, or `c`.

### Quantifiers 

Quantifiers specify how many times a character or a group of characters in a regex pattern should be matched. Some quantifiers include `*`, `+`, and `?`. The `*` quantifier means match zero or more occurrences of the preceding character. The `+` quantifier means match one or more of the preceding character. The `?` quantifier means match zero or one of the preceding character.

### Anchors 

Anchors are used to match a specific position in a string. Some anchors include `^` and `$`. The `^` anchor means match the beginning of a string. The `$` anchor means match the end of a string.

In Python, the `re` module provides various functions to work with regex patterns. Let's explore some of them.

### The `match()` Function 

The `match()` function is used to match a regex pattern at the beginning of a string. It returns a match object if the pattern matches; otherwise, it returns `None`. Here's an example:

``` python
import re

string = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
pattern = r"The"

match = re.match(pattern, string)
print(match)
```

Output:

```
<re.Match object; span=(0, 3), match='The'>
```

In the above example, we are trying to match the pattern `The` at the beginning of the string `string`. The output shows that the pattern is found at index 0 and ends at index 3.

### The `search()` Function 

The `search()` function is used to search for a regex pattern anywhere in a string. It returns a match object if the pattern matches; otherwise, it returns `None`. Here's an example:

``` python
import re

string = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
pattern = r"fox"

match = re.search(pattern, string)
print(match)
```

Output:

```
<re.Match object; span=(16, 19), match='fox'>
```

In the above example, we are trying to match the pattern `fox` anywhere in the string `string`. The output shows that the pattern is found at index 16 and ends at index 19.

### The `findall()` Function 

The `findall()` function is used to find all occurrences of a pattern in a string. It returns a list of all matches found. Here's an example:

``` python
import re

string = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
pattern = r"the"

matches = re.findall(pattern, string)
print(matches)
```

Output:

```
['the', 'the']
```

In the above example, we are trying to match all occurrences of the pattern `the` in the string `string`. The output shows that there are two matches: one at index 8 and the other at index 31.

### The `sub()` Function 

The `sub()` function is used to replace a pattern with some text in a string. It returns a modified string with the replaced text. Here's an example:

``` python
import re

string = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
pattern = r"brown"

new_string = re.sub(pattern, "red", string)
print(new_string)
```

Output:

```
The quick red fox jumps over the lazy dog
```

In the above example, we are replacing the pattern `brown` with the text `red` in the string `string`. The output shows that the word `brown` is replaced by `red`.

## Advanced Concepts of Regular Expressions 

Next, let's explore some advanced regex concepts that can help you manipulate text data more effectively.

### Greedy Matching 

Greedy matching means matching as much as possible while still allowing the regex pattern to succeed. For example, the regex pattern `a.*b` will match the entire string `aabbbbbb`. Here's an example:

``` python
import re

string = "aabbbbbb"
pattern = r"a.*b"

match = re.match(pattern, string)
print(match)
```

Output:

```
<re.Match object; span=(0, 8), match='aabbbbbb'>
```

In the above example, we are trying to match the pattern `a.*b` in the string `string`. The `.*` part is a greedy match, which means it will match as many characters as possible between `a` and `b`.

### Non-Greedy Matching 

Non-greedy matching means matching as little as possible while still allowing the regex pattern to succeed. For example, the regex pattern `a.*?b` will match the string `aab`. Here's an example:

``` python
import re

string = "aabbbbbb"
pattern = r"a.*?b"

match = re.match(pattern, string)
print(match)
```

Output:

```
<re.Match object; span=(0, 3), match='aab'>
```

In the above example, we are trying to match the pattern `a.*?b` in the string `string`. The `.*?` part is a non-greedy match, which means it will match as few characters as possible between `a` and `b`.

### Lookahead 

Lookahead means matching a pattern only if it is followed by another pattern. For example, the regex pattern `foo(?=bar)` will match the string `foobar` but not `foobaz`. Here's an example:

``` python
import re

string1 = "foobar"
string2 = "foobaz"
pattern = r"foo(?=bar)"

match1 = re.search(pattern, string1)
match2 = re.search(pattern, string2)

print(match1)
print(match2)
```

Output:

```
<re.Match object; span=(0, 3), match='foo'>
None
```

In the above example, we are trying to match the pattern `foo(?=bar)` in both strings `string1` and `string2`. The output shows that the pattern matches `foobar` but not `foobaz`.

### Lookbehind 

Lookbehind means matching a pattern only if it is preceded by another pattern. For example, the regex pattern `(?<=foo)bar` will match the string `foobar` but not `bazbar`. Here's an example:

``` python
import re

string1 = "foobar"
string2 = "bazbar"
pattern = r"(?<=foo)bar"

match1 = re.search(pattern, string1)
match2 = re.search(pattern, string2)

print(match1)
print(match2)
```

Output:

```
<re.Match object; span=(3, 6), match='bar'>
None
```

In the above example, we are trying to match the pattern `(?<=foo)bar` in both strings `string1` and `string2`. The output shows that the pattern matches `foobar` but not `bazbar`.

## Conclusion
