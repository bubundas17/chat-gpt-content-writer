Are you tired of making cupcakes that turn out too dry, too dense, or simply not quite perfect? With these 3 easy steps, you can make perfectly fluffy, moist, and delicious cupcakes every time. You'll be amazed at how easy it is to create bakery-worthy treats that will impress everyone.

Step 1: Preparing the Batter

The secret to perfect cupcakes lies in the batter. For basic vanilla cupcakes, you need 1 1/2 cups (200g) of all-purpose flour, 1 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1/2 cup (113g) of unsalted butter (at room temperature), 1 cup (200g) of granulated sugar, 2 large eggs (at room temperature), 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract, and 1/2 cup (120ml) of milk.

To start, preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a cupcake pan with paper liners. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.

In a large bowl, beat the butter and sugar together with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until creamy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Then, beat in the vanilla extract. Gradually add the dry ingredients, alternating with the milk, until everything is combined. Be careful not to overmix.

Step 2: Baking the Cupcakes

Once the batter is ready, it's time to bake the cupcakes. Fill each liner about 2/3 full with batter using a spoon or an ice cream scoop. Tap the pan gently on the countertop to remove any air bubbles.

Bake for 18-20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cupcake comes out clean. Be sure not to overbake, as this can cause the cupcakes to be dry or tough.

Step 3: Decorating the Cupcakes

The final step is the fun part: decorating your cupcakes. Once the cupcakes have cooled completely, you can frost them with your favorite frosting or add any toppings you like. You can also make your cupcakes more unique by adding food coloring to the batter before baking, or by filling them with jam or cream.

That's it! With these 3 easy steps, you can make perfect cupcakes every time. Experiment with different flavors and toppings to create customized cupcakes that are sure to impress.
