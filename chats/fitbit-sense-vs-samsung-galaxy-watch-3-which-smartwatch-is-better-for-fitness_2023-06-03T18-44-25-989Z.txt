The market for smartwatches has been booming over the past few years as people have become increasingly health-conscious and eager to track their fitness progress. Two of the major players in this market are Fitbit and Samsung, both of which offer an extensive range of wearables that cater to the fitness enthusiast. In this post, we’ll be pitting the Fitbit Sense against the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 to see which one is the better choice for fitness enthusiasts.

Design and Display

When it comes to design, both the Fitbit Sense and Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 are exceptionally well-crafted. The Fitbit Sense has an elegant, lightweight aluminum body that exudes sophistication, while the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 has a stainless steel frame that gives it a more rugged and robust look. Both smartwatches have AMOLED displays, with the Galaxy Watch 3 featuring a larger 1.4-inch display compared to the Sense's 1.18-inch display. 

Winner: Tie - Both are well-designed and have high-quality displays.

Fitness Features and Health Metrics

Both Fitbit Sense and Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 are loaded with fitness features and health metrics. The Fitbit Sense boasts a range of sensors, including a blood oxygen sensor (SpO2), an electrodermal activity (EDA) sensor, a heart rate monitor, and an accelerometer for tracking steps, floors climbed, and calories burned. The Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 also features a heart rate monitor, a blood oxygen sensor, and an accelerometer, but lacks the EDA sensor for stress monitoring. 

The Fitbit Sense also has exclusive features like Fitbit's Active Zone Minutes, which helps users track the effort they're putting into their workouts. Additionally, the Sense also has a mindfulness feature, which tracks breathing exercises and provides audible prompts to help users regulate their breathing and reduce stress.

Battery Life and Charging

The Fitbit Sense has a battery life of up to 6 days, while the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 has a battery life of up to 2 days. However, it’s worth noting that these numbers vary depending on usage and settings. When it comes to charging, the Fitbit Sense boasts a quick 12-minute charge that can provide a day’s worth of battery life. The Samsung Galaxy Watch 3, on the other hand, takes about an hour to fully charge.

Winner: Fitbit Sense - Longer battery life and quicker charging.

Smart Features

Both smartwatches come with a range of smart features such as GPS, NFC, voice assistants, and mobile payments. However, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 takes the edge with its advanced functionality- users can make and receive calls and texts with the watch via a Bluetooth connection, while the Fitbit Sense lacks this feature.

Winner: Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 - More advanced functionality than the Fitbit Sense.

Price

The Fitbit Sense starts at $299.95, while the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 starts at $399.99. The prices go up depending on the variants and additional features.

The Fitbit Sense wins for its fitness features and long battery life, while the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 stands out with its advanced smart features like the ability to make phone calls and send text messages. Ultimately, it comes down to personal preference and what features you prioritize.Regardless of which smartwatch you choose, both the Fitbit Sense and Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 are excellent options for fitness enthusiasts who want to monitor their health and fitness progress.
