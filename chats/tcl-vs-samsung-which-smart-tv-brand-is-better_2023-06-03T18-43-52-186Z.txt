When it comes to buying a new smart TV, there are a lot of brands to choose from. Two of the biggest names in the market are TCL and Samsung. With both brands offering a range of smart TVs with various specifications and features, choosing between them can be tricky. In this article, we'll take a closer look at TCL vs Samsung to help you decide which brand is the best for you.

Display Quality:
When it comes to display quality, both brands have their own strengths. TCL's QLED TVs offer a wide color gamut and striking brightness levels, delivering great picture quality. Meanwhile, Samsung's QLED TVs are amongst the best in the market, offering deep blacks, high contrast ratios, and bright HDR highlights for amazing picture quality.

Smart Features:
Both TCL and Samsung offer smart TVs with a range of features to make streaming easy. However, there are some differences between the two brands in this regard. Samsung's Tizen OS is considered one of the best in the market, offering easy-to-navigate menus, voice assistant support, and access to all major streaming apps. TCL's Roku TV platform is also very intuitive, providing an extensive range of channels and apps from the home screen.

Design:
When it comes to design, Samsung smart TVs often stand out. The brand's high-end models offer modern, sleek designs with thin bezels and premium build materials. TCL, on the other hand, tends to have a more minimalistic design approach. However, the design differences between the two brands are ultimately down to personal preference.

Price:
One of the biggest differences between TCL and Samsung smart TVs is the price. For the same size TV, TCL TVs are often significantly cheaper than their Samsung counterparts. This price difference can make TCL a more accessible option for those on a budget.

Overall, both TCL and Samsung offer great options for smart TVs. While Samsung TVs tend to have a slight edge in picture quality and design, TCL TVs are a great option for those looking for a budget-friendly smart TV with an impressive feature set. Ultimately it all comes down to what you prioritize the most - picture quality, smart features, or price. Choose the option that best suits your needs and budget.
