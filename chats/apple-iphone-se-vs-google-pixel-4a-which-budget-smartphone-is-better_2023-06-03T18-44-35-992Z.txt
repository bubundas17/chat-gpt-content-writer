If you are in the market for a new smartphone that won't break the bank, you may be torn between the Apple iPhone SE and the Google Pixel 4a. Both smartphones offer impressive features at a reasonable price point but with some key differences. In this post, we compare the two to help you find the right smartphone for you.

**Design and build quality**

When it comes to the design and build quality, both Apple and Google have done a great job. The iPhone SE comes with a compact design and looks a lot like the iPhone 8, while the Pixel 4a has a modern and sleek look with a punch-hole Camera. The iPhone SE features a glass back and an aluminum frame. The Pixel 4a, on the other hand, has a polycarbonate back with a plastic frame that gives it a plastic feel. Both are solid and well-built mid-range phones so it’s really a personal preference of aesthetics as to which one you'll prefer.

**Display**

While the iPhone SE has clearly the better chipset, the Pixel 4a is a clear winner when it comes to display quality. The Pixel 4a sports a 5.81-inch OLED display with 1080 x 2340 resolution, while the iPhone SE has a 4.7-inch IPS LCD with 720 x 1334 resolution. The OLED panel offers better contrast, deeper blacks and richer colours than Apple's IPS LCD.

**Camera**

When it comes to camera performance, both phones are ahead of their competition in the budget segment. The Pixel 4a has a single 12.2-megapixel rear camera that produces amazing pictures with its Night Sight mode and captures phenomenal portrait shots with its stunning background separation. The iPhone SE, on the other hand, has a single 12-megapixel rear camera that also takes great photos, but the software in the Pixel 4A is more advanced and produces better overall results. 

The front camera comparison is an interesting one. Apple chose an 7MP front camera, while Google used an 8MP front camera. The difference in an everyday usage scenario is almost negligible.

 **Performance**

When it comes to performance, the iPhone SE has the upper hand with its A13 Bionic chip that easily outperforms the Pixel 4a's Snapdragon 730 processor. The difference in performance is clearly noticeable in day-to-day usage as the iPhone SE is the schnappiest and most responsive device. However, this difference is most notable for high-end gaming and AR performance, so if that's not a priority for you, the Pixel 4a's Snapdragon 730 chip will suffice. 

**Battery and Charging**

The Pixel 4a has a 3,140mAh battery which lasts all day, thanks to the highly optimized software running the device. The iPhone SE is powered by a 1,821mAh battery. While the battery life is acceptable, it is significantly less than the Pixel 4a. As for charging, both devices offer fast charging support, but only the Pixel 4a comes with a 18W charger in the box, while the iPhone SE comes with a very slow charger in the box. Both also offer wireless charging, but only the iPhone SE supports fast wireless charging with the right equipment

**Software: iOS vs Android**

When purchasing the iPhone SE, you’ll be using iOS out of the box. If you’re already an iPhone user, the jump will be smooth and easy, or even if you’re not, Apple’s software is dead-easy. The Pixel 4a, on the other hand, runs on Android 10 and will appeal to anyone who values a highly customizable and flexible experience but it doesn’t have the overall ease-of-use that Apple’s platform offers.

**Price**

The iPhone SE starts at $399 for the 64GB model. If you want the 128GB version, you’ll pay $50 more. The Pixel 4a is priced at $349 for the 128GB version. The $50 price difference makes the Pixel 4a a better value considering the better camera, superior display and battery life. In addition, Google offers some excellent features such as Google Photos storage, 3 years of OS updates, and call transcription that make it a better bargain for many consumers.

**Conclusion**

Both the iPhone SE and Pixel 4a are among the best budget smartphones in the market. The iPhone SE offers great build quality and performance, while the Pixel 4a excels with its display and camera performance and superior battery life. The decision ultimately comes down to operating system preferences and budget. If you’re already an iOS user or looking for the best performance from a small device, the iPhone SE is the choice for you. But if you prefer a device with a better display, longer battery life, and more value for your money, then the Pixel 4a is the phone for you.
