Step 3: Discover Your Passions 
What is it that entices you? What do you enjoy doing the most? Discover your passions by making a list of activities that you find enjoyable, and that ignites your soul. If you can't think of anything, explore new opportunities and challenge yourself to step out of your comfort zone. The more you enjoy something, the more likely it is to be tied to your purpose.

Finally, the last step in discovering your purpose is action. Take action to bring your vision to life by setting small daily goals that lead you towards your vision. Stay aligned with your values and passions to remain motivated, be patient, and always stay true to your purpose.

In conclusion, discovering your purpose is crucial for living a fulfilling and happy life.
