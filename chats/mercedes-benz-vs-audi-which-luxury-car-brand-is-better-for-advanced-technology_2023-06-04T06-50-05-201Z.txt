Additionally, Pre-Safe systems can detect possible collisions and minimize the impact, making for a safer experience.

## Connectivity
Mercedes-Benz and Audi match each other when it comes to connectivity technologies. Both brands offer wireless technology options, integrated smart home capabilities, and smartphone integration. These connectivity options allow users to access many features including remote start, fuel level checks, and diagnostic reports.

Audi does offer a differentiating factor though, through its Audi connect service that offers faster cellular connections, enabling HD video streaming and secure mobile connections. Audi’s mobile connectivity pairs well with its advanced voice recognition.

## Conclusion

Both Mercedes-Benz and Audi models offer an impressive suite of advanced features. It is challenging to make a broad assessment of which one offers superior advanced technology.

However, Mercedes has taken the lead on AI-driven infotainment and advanced driver assistance, while Audi has an edge on mobile connectivity options. Your choice will come down to your primary area of focus. If infotainment and driver-assist take priority, the Mercedes-Benz is an excellent choice. However, if connectivity is more critical, the Audi may be a better choice.
