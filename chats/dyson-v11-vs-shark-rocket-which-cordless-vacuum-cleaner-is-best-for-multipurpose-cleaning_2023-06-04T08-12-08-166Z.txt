The market for cordless vacuum cleaners has been growing in recent years with more people looking for convenience and freedom while cleaning. Two of the most popular options are the Dyson V11 and the Shark Rocket. Both of these vacuums come with impressive features and capabilities that homeowners crave, but which one is better for multipurpose cleaning? Let's find out.

# Dyson V11

Dyson is a well-known brand in the field of vacuum cleaners, and its V11 cordless model boasts powerful suction and impressive battery life. Here are some of its notable features:

### Design and Build Quality

The Dyson V11 has an impressive design that is ergonomic and feels sturdy in your hand. It's an all-plastic construction with a wand and a head that forms an 'S' shape for easy navigation under furniture. The vacuum cleaner is lightweight and easy to maneuver, making cleaning a breeze.

### Suction Power

One of the top features of the Dyson V11 is its suction power. The vacuum cleaner has a motor that spins at 125,000 RPM, which results in powerful suction that can easily handle large debris without any trouble. Furthermore, the V11 has three suction modes: Eco, Auto, and Boost, allowing you to customize the suction to the surface you're cleaning.

### Battery Life

The Dyson V11 comes with a slightly larger battery than its predecessor, the V10, allowing it to run for up to 60 minutes on a single charge, depending on the mode you're using it in. The battery is also removable, making it easy to swap out for a spare.

### Filtration System

The V11 uses a fully sealed filtration system that captures 99.97% of microscopic particles, making it an excellent choice for those suffering from allergies or asthma.

# Shark Rocket

Shark is another popular brand in the vacuum cleaner market, and its Rocket cordless model is designed to compete head-to-head with the Dyson V11. Here are some of its notable features:

### Design and Build Quality

The Shark Rocket has an ultra-slim design that makes it easy to store and maneuver. It features a wand and a head that swivels, making it easy to clean hard-to-reach areas. The vacuum cleaner is lightweight, weighing only 7.5 pounds, and feels sturdy in your hand.

### Suction Power

The Shark Rocket also has impressive suction power, thanks to its powerful motor that can handle all kinds of debris with ease. It comes with a MultiFLEX wand that bends to give you better access to hard-to-reach areas.

### Battery Life

The Shark Rocket boasts a runtime of 40 minutes on a single charge, depending on the mode you're using it in. It also comes with a removable battery making it easy to swap out for a spare.

### Filtration System

The Shark Rocket uses a washable foam and felt filter system that can capture up to 99.9% of dirt, dust, and allergens.

# Which One to Choose for Multipurpose Cleaning?

Both the Dyson V11 and the Shark Rocket are great cordless vacuums, but which one is better for multipurpose cleaning?

If you're looking for a more powerful suction and longer battery life, the Dyson V11 is the way to go. It's ideal for cleaning large debris like cereal, pet hair, and even larger items with ease. However, it's also pricier than the Shark Rocket.

On the other hand, if you're on a budget and want a cordless vacuum that's easy to use, the Shark Rocket is an excellent choice. It can handle most debris, has a lightweight design, and is easy to maneuver thanks to its swivel head.

Ultimately, both vacuums are good at handling different cleaning needs, and it comes down to personal preference and budget. If you have the budget, we recommend going with the Dyson V11 for its superior suction and battery life. Otherwise, the Shark Rocket is a great option for those on a budget who still want a high-quality cordless vacuum cleaner that can handle most cleaning tasks.
