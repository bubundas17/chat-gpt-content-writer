Vue.js is a popular JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications. It provides a flexible and intuitive way of handling user input and form validation.

In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of handling user input and form validation in Vue.js. We will cover the following topics:

- Handling user input with v-model
- Validating user input with computed properties
- Displaying validation errors with v-show and v-if
- Preventing form submission with prevent and submit modifiers
- Implementing custom form validation rules
- Using third-party form validation libraries

Without further ado, let's get started.

## Handling User Input with v-model

Vue.js provides a simple and powerful way of handling user input with the `v-model` directive. This directive creates a two-way binding between a form input element and a data property in the Vue instance.

Here is an example of a simple form with two input fields:

```
<template>
  <form>
    <label>
      Name:
      <input type="text" v-model="name">
    </label>
    <label>
      Email:
      <input type="email" v-model="email">
    </label>
  </form>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      name: '',
      email: '',
    };
  },
};
</script>
```

In this example, we use the `v-model` directive to bind the `name` and `email` input elements to their respective data properties in the Vue instance. Whenever the user types into any of the input fields, the corresponding data property is updated automatically.

## Validating User Input with Computed Properties

Now that we have bound user input to data properties using `v-model`, we need to validate this input to ensure it meets the required criteria. 

Vue.js provides computed properties for handling input validation. A computed property is a function that returns a value based on the data properties it depends on. 

Here is how we can use computed properties for input validation:

```
<template>
  <form>
    <label>
      Name:
      <input type="text" v-model="name">
    </label>
    <p v-show="nameError">{{ nameError }}</p>
  
    <label>
      Email:
      <input type="email" v-model="email">
    </label>
    <p v-show="emailError">{{ emailError }}</p>
  
    <button type="button" @click="submitForm">Submit</button>
  </form>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      name: '',
      email: '',
    };
  },
  
  computed: {
    nameError() {
      if (!this.name) {
        return 'Name is required';
      } else if (this.name.length < 3) {
        return 'Name must be at least 3 characters';
      }
      return '';
    },
  
    emailError() {
      if (!this.email) {
        return 'Email is required';
      } else if (!this.email.includes('@')) {
        return 'Email must be valid';
      }
      return '';
    },
  },
  
  methods: {
    submitForm() {
      if (!this.nameError && !this.emailError) {
        // Submit the form
      } else {
        console.error('Form has validation errors');
      }
    },
  },
};
</script>
```

In this example, we use computed properties to validate the `name` and `email` inputs. The `nameError` computed property checks if the `name` input is empty or has fewer than three characters. The `emailError` computed property checks if the `email` input is empty or does not contain the `@` character.

The validation errors are displayed with the `v-show` directive, which shows the element only if the condition is truthy.

## Preventing Form Submission

To prevent form submission, we can use the `prevent` modifier with the `submit` event. This modifier calls `event.preventDefault()` to stop the default form submission behavior.

Here is an example:

```
<template>
  <form @submit.prevent="submitForm">
    <label>
      Name:
      <input type="text" v-model="name">
    </label>
    <p v-show="nameError">{{ nameError }}</p>
  
    <label>
      Email:
      <input type="email" v-model="email">
    </label>
    <p v-show="emailError">{{ emailError }}</p>
  
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      name: '',
      email: '',
    };
  },
  
  computed: {
    ...
  },
  
  methods: {
    submitForm() {
      if (!this.nameError && !this.emailError) {
        // Submit the form
      } else {
        console.error('Form has validation errors');
      }
    },
  },
};
</script>
```

In this example, we use the `prevent` modifier with the `submit` event to prevent the default form submission behavior. Instead, we call the `submitForm` method to handle the form submission ourselves. 

## Implementing Custom Form Validation Rules

Vue.js allows us to implement our own custom form validation rules by defining custom computed properties that depend on the input data.

Here is an example of a custom validation rule that checks if a password has at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number:

```
<template>
  <form>
    <label>
      Password:
      <input type="password" v-model="password">
    </label>
    <p v-show="passwordError">{{ passwordError }}</p>
  </form>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      password: '',
    };
  },
  
  computed: {
    passwordError() {
      const uppercaseRegex = /[A-Z]/;
      const lowercaseRegex = /[a-z]/;
      const numberRegex = /\d/;
  
      if (!this.password) {
        return 'Password is required';
      } else if (this.password.length < 8) {
        return 'Password must be at least 8 characters';
      } else if (!uppercaseRegex.test(this.password) || !lowercaseRegex.test(this.password) || !numberRegex.test(this.password)) {
        return 'Password must contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number';
      }
      return '';
    },
  },
};
</script>
```

In this example, we define a custom computed property called `passwordError` that checks if the `password` input meets the required criteria. The password must be at least eight characters long and contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number.

## Using Third-Party Form Validation Libraries

Vue.js also supports third-party form validation libraries such as Vuelidate, VeeValidate, and vuelidation. These libraries provide additional validation functionality, including asynchronous validation, rule chaining, and custom error messages.

To use Vuelidate, for example, we need to install it using npm or yarn:

```
npm install vuelidate
```

Then, we can import and use it in our Vue component:

```
<template>
  <form>
    <label>
      Email:
      <input type="email" v-model="email">
      <span v-show="$v.email.$error">{{ $v.email.$message }}</span>
    </label>
  
    <label>
      Password:
      <input type="password" v-model="password">
      <span v-show="$v.password.$error">{{ $v.password.$message }}</span>
    </label>
  
    <button type="submit" :disabled="$v.$invalid">Submit</button>
  </form>
</template>

<script>
import { required, email } from 'vuelidate/lib/validators';

export default {
  data() {
    return {
      email: '',
      password: '',
    };
  },
  
  validations: {
    email: {
      required,
      email,
    },
  
    password: {
      required,
      minLength: minLength(8),
      containsUppercase: containsUppercase,
      containsLowercase: containsLowercase,
      containsNumber: containsNumber,
    },
  },
};
</script>
```

In this example, we import the `required` and `email` validators from Vuelidate and use them to validate the `email` input. We also define custom validators for validating the `password` input, such as `minLength`, `containsUppercase`, `containsLowercase`, and `containsNumber`.

The validation errors are displayed with the `v-show` directive as before. We also use the `$v.$invalid` property to disable the submit button if the form has validation errors.

## Conclusion

Handling user input and form validation is an essential part of frontend development. Vue.js provides a flexible and intuitive way of handling user input and form validation, as we have seen in this tutorial.
