Nowadays, people are becoming more aware of the sedentary lifestyle that they're engaging in. Sitting for long hours during work can lead to various health issues, such as back pain, poor posture, and decreased productivity. That's where standing desks come in handy.

Standing desks have gained popularity in recent years due to their health benefits.

## Types of Standing Desks

2. Manual Crank Desks - These desks come with a crank that you can turn to adjust the height of the desk. They are more flexible than static desks and can be adjusted to better fit your body. 

3. Electric Standing Desks - These are the most popular type of standing desk available today. The height of the desk can be adjusted using an electric motor, allowing for easy movement from sitting to standing position. These are ideal for users who have multiple people using the desk or who need to adjust the height frequently. 

4. Desktop Converters - For those who already have a desk and want to convert it to a standing desk, desktop converters are a perfect solution. These are add-ons that can be placed on top of a regular desk and can be raised or lowered to provide an adjustable-height workspace.

2. Stability and Weight Capacity - Make sure the desk is sturdy enough to support the weight of your computer, monitor, and other equipment you'll be using. 

3. Ease of Use - Check if the desk is easy to operate and adjust. Some desks can be quite complicated to use, while others have a simple push-button system.
