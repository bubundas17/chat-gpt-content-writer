Underscores Framework is a popular WordPress starter theme that is used by developers to create custom WordPress themes. It’s a lightweight and flexible theme that provides a solid foundation for building a fully customizable WordPress theme. In this tutorial, we will explain how to develop a customizable WordPress theme using the Underscores Framework. 

**1. Download and Install Underscores**

The first step is to download and install the Underscores starter theme from the website. You can find the download link at underscores.me. After downloading the theme, extract the files and rename the folder according to the name of your theme. 

**2. Customize Theme Options**

Next, you need to customize the theme options to suit your preferences. Open the functions.php file and look for the following line of code:

`add_theme_support( 'custom-logo' );` 

This line of code adds support for a custom logo in the theme. You can also add support for other theme features like post thumbnails, custom backgrounds, and custom headers by modifying this code. 

**3. Create Template Files**

After customizing the theme options, the next step is to create template files for your WordPress theme. Underscores provides a variety of template files to choose from, including index.php, header.php, footer.php, and sidebar.php.

Using these template files, you can create custom pages, posts, and categories for your WordPress site. You can also create custom page templates for different sections of your site. 

**4. Add Styles and Scripts**

Once you have created the template files for your WordPress theme, you need to add styles and scripts to make it look and feel the way you want. Underscores comes with a style.css file that serves as a starting point for your theme’s styling. You can also add custom CSS code to this file to further customize your theme’s appearance.

Underscores also allows you to add custom JavaScript code by creating a new file in the js directory. You can use this file to add functionality to your theme, such as custom widgets, sliders, or other interactive elements. 

**5. Test Your Theme**

Finally, it’s time to test your theme to ensure that it’s working properly. You can do this by activating your theme in the WordPress dashboard and previewing it in the front-end. Make sure that all the elements of your theme are displaying correctly and that it is fully functional. 

**Conclusion**

In this tutorial, we have explained how to use the Underscores starter theme to build a fully customizable WordPress theme. We’ve covered the basics of customizing theme options, creating template files, adding styles and scripts, and testing your theme. By following these steps, you can create a unique and tailored WordPress theme that meets the specific needs of your website or blog.
