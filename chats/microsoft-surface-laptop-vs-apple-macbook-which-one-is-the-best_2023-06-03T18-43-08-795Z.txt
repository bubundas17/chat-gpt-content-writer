One of the standout features of the Surface Laptop is its touchscreen display. The PixelSense display offers vibrant colors and crisp resolution, making it an excellent device for art and design work. In addition, the Surface Laptop's keyboard is top-notch, with backlit keys that are comfortable to type on.
