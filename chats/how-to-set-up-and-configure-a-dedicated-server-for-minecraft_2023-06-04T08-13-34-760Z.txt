Minecraft is a popular online game that has been around since 2011. It has grown from a small indie game to a one of the most popular games in the world. With the rise in popularity, many players are looking for ways to host their own Minecraft server. In this tutorial, we will explain how to set up and configure a dedicated Minecraft server on Windows or Linux server. 

## Choose Your Server Hosting Provider 

Before setting up a Minecraft server, you must first decide on a server hosting provider. There are many options available, such as:

1. Microsoft Azure 
2. DigitalOcean 
3. OVH 
4. Amazon Web Services 

Research each option to find one that best suits your needs, including your budget and the number of players you expect to have on your server. 

## Installing and Configuring Java 

A Minecraft server is a Java program, so you need to install Java on your server. First, check if Java is already installed on your machine by typing the following command: 

`java -version` 

If Java is not installed, download and install the version appropriate to your operating system. Once Java is installed, make sure it is in the system path. 

## Setting up Minecraft Server 

1. Download Minecraft server files from the official Minecraft website or from the server hosting provider's website. 

2. Create a new directory on your server and copy the downloaded server files to that directory. 

3. In the same directory, create a new file named `eula.txt` and add the following line: 

`eula=true` 

4. Run the server for the first time using the following command: 

`java -Xms1G -Xmx1G -jar server.jar nogui` 

This command starts the server with 1GB of memory. If you have more memory available, you can increase these values to improve performance. 

5. Stop the server by typing "stop" in the console.

## Configuring Server Properties

After stopping the server, you now need to configure the server properties.  Open the `server.properties` file with a text editor and make the following changes:

1. **Server IP:** If your server is hosted on the same machine you're playing, leave the IP empty. Otherwise, add the server IP address. 

2. **Game Mode:** Change the game mode to either survival or creative mode.

3. **Difficulty:** Set the difficulty level.

4. **Max Players:** Set the maximum number of players allowed on the server.

5. **Spawn Protection Radius:** Set the radius in blocks around spawn where players are protected.

## Configuring Firewall

You need to configure the firewall to allow Minecraft traffic to reach your server. Add the following rule to the firewall configuration: 

`sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 25565 -j ACCEPT` 

## Installing Plugins and Mods

Plugins and mods enhance gameplay and add features to the server. There are many available to choose from, such as Spigot, Bukkit, and Paper. Choose one that best suits your needs and follow the installation instructions. 

## Optimizing Server Performance

Lastly, to optimize server performance, you can make the following changes:

1. Increase server memory by editing the `-Xmx` flag in the command used to start the server 

2. Disable server features you're not using 

3. Use server-optimized Java arguments, which you can find by searching online.

4. Using a solid-state drive (SSD) instead of a hard disk drive (HDD) can also boost performance. 

5. Use a powerful CPU or processor and high-speed internet connectivity. 

By following these steps, you can set up and configure a dedicated Minecraft server on either Windows or Linux. This will allow you to enjoy the game with your friends or even run a multiplayer server for other players.
