Virtualization technology has revolutionized the IT environment, enabling businesses to optimize resource utilization and gain significant competitive advantages. The flexible nature of virtual machines has made it increasingly easy for businesses to set up and run multiple operating systems on a single physical server. However, managing these virtualized servers effectively can be a complex task. In this post, we will outline some best practices for monitoring virtualized servers, to ensure maximum efficiency and productivity in your IT infrastructure.

1. Use the Right Monitoring Tools

One of the critical aspects of monitoring virtualized servers is having the right tools for the job. Monitoring software should be integrated with your virtualization infrastructure, capable of monitoring virtual machines and the underlying physical infrastructure.

2. Optimize Resource Utilization

Virtualization can only be an effective solution if the resources are utilized optimally. Hence, monitoring resource utilization is crucial. You should continuously monitor the virtual machine resource usage like storage, RAM, and CPU usage. With the right monitoring tool, you can identify any bottlenecks in the resource allocation and optimize them.

3. Monitor the Health Status

It is vital to keep an eye on the health of the physical servers and virtual machines. Monitoring tools should notify administrators immediately of critical issues. The system should be set up in a way that when any virtual machines are down, the system will be start alerts to the concerned person.

4. Maintain Proper Security

Security is among the top priorities in virtualization. Therefore, security monitoring and remediation must be incorporated into the virtual machine infrastructure. Firewall, IDS/IPS, and Antivirus should be installed on virtual machines that require security measures.

5. Utilize Cloud Computing

More businesses are taking advantage of the cloud for its scalability and distributed nature. It's essential to monitor the virtual servers on such platforms because, unlike the traditional server setups, cloud-based servers can go down frequently. A monitoring system will help you keep track of the cloud computing resources and promptly notify you of any potential issues.

6. Consolidate Virtual Machines

Monitoring the number of virtual machines is as crucial as monitoring their usage. Suppose you obtain statistics on machines that aren't being leveraged and rarely interact with them or never at all. In that case, it may be worth consolidation effort to reduce the number of virtual servers running to increase utilization.

7. Automate Monitoring Processes

It is an absolute necessity to automate every monitoring process to get reports quickly. Numerous cloud vendors and IT firms utilize AI-based technologies with machine learning, which can predict any anomalies or future crashes and help prevent them by notifying the administrators beforehand.

In conclusion, with the rise in virtualization, there is a growing need to maintain a healthy IT infrastructure. The best practices discussed in this post will help organizations monitor their virtualized servers, optimize resource utilization, minimize downtime, enhance security, and automate the monitoring process, ensuring seamless and efficient virtualized server infrastructure operations.By following these best practices for monitoring virtualized servers, businesses can maximize the benefits of virtualization while minimizing the risks. Having the right tools and processes in place can help organizations maintain a healthy IT infrastructure, optimize resource utilization, enhance security, and automate the monitoring process. 

Ultimately, proper virtualized server management is essential to support business operations and growth. Therefore, paying attention to monitoring virtualized servers is crucial to optimize their performance and availability, ensuring the ongoing smooth running of your IT infrastructure.
