With the advent of modern technologies, the tourism industry has undergone a massive transformation in recent years. The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) in the tourism sector has brought in a new era, turning ordinary destinations into smart destinations. IoT is being used to develop innovative solutions for the industry ranging from smart booking systems to personalized services for consumers.

IoT technology has opened new avenues for the tourism industry. Not only does it enhance the service quality but also empower the travelers to make empowering decisions. There are several applications of IoT in the smart tourism industry:

1. Smart Hotels and Accommodation: 
The IoT has revolutionized the way hotels and accommodation operate. Smart hotels use IoT devices to offer personalization to customers from check-in to check-out. With IoT, there is the possibility of remote sensing and monitoring of guests' behavior, preferences, and mood. This information is used to offer an all-encompassing experience, enhancing the guest experience.

2. Smart Transportation: 
Travelers can now utilize smart transportation services with the use of IoT technology. IoT sensors can be installed in public transport to notify travelers on bus schedules and routes. Smart cameras, traffic signals, and GPS equipped vehicles can be used to provide real-time traffic updates to drivers and mobile applications.

3. Smart Cities: 
IoT is being used to design smart cities that maximize the tourism experience for visitors. Smart cities use sensors to monitor peopleâ€™s behavior and optimize their overall tourist experience using the data collected. IoT also offers real-time information about the tourist attractions and cultural events happening in the city, which can be retrieved using mobile applications. It has made traveling hassle-free and comfortable for tourists.

4. Multilingual Services: 
IoT offers a great platform for interaction with people from around the world by further enhancing language barriers. Smart devices can be used to enable automatic two-way translation in multiple languages, which helps travelers to communicate with locals more efficiently.

5. Wearables and IoT Devices: 
IoT has taken wearable technology to new heights by incorporating it into the tourism sector. Wearables such as smartwatches and smart glasses can be used to offer personalized experiences to tourists. For example, With smartwatches, visitors can get real-time information on places to visit, things to do, and events happening around them. Whereas, with smart glasses, augmented reality can be used to enhance sightseeing experiences.

Conclusion: 
IoT technology has the potential to change the face of the tourism industry in unimaginable ways. With its smart applications, IoT can create superior customer experiences by offering personalized services and making traveling more comfortable. The introduction of IoT in the tourism industry can attract more tourists, which can result in economic growth for the hosting places. It is only the beginning of the integration of IoT in smart tourism, and there are several untapped potentials that this technology can bring to the table. Organizations in the industry need to be ready to adapt to this new technology to remain competitive.
