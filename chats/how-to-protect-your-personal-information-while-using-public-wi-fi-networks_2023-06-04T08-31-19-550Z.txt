Public Wi-Fi networks offer easy and free access to the internet for anyone on-the-go but can be a recipe for disaster when it comes to cybersecurity and protecting your personal information. Hackers and identity thieves prey on these types of networks where users most likely assume their information is secure. To keep you and your sensitive information safe while using public Wi-Fi networks, here is a list of ten tips:

1. Verify the Network: Before connecting to a public Wi-Fi network, make sure the network you are joining is legitimate, and not a fake hotspot set up by cybercriminals. Check with the venue, or use a virtual private network (VPN).

2. Use a VPN: A VPN creates a secure "tunnel" between your device and the internet, encrypting all the data that passes through it. It is an essential tool for keeping your information safe on public Wi-Fi.

3. Use Encrypted Websites: Use websites that encrypt their data, such as HTTPS sites, which add an extra layer of security to your web traffic. You can also use browser extensions that automatically switch HTTP sites to HTTPS.

4. Disable Automatic Connections: Turn off automatic Wi-Fi connections on your devices' settings to prevent them from automatically joining nearby networks without permission.

5. Enable Firewall Protection: Ensure your device's firewall is turned on and active, which will help protect you from malicious inbound connections.

6. Turn Off Sharing: Disable file-sharing settings in your device's network settings to limit the exposure of sensitive information.

7. Use Two-Factor Authentication: Many websites and apps offer two-factor authentication, which provides extra security by requiring an additional step to verify your identity when logging in from a new device or location.

8. Avoid Sensitive Tasks: Do not perform sensitive tasks, such as online banking or entering credit card details until you are on a secure and trusted network.

9. Keep Your Devices Updated: Make sure you regularly update your device's operating system, web browsers, and security software to ensure your device has the latest security patches.

10. Use Antivirus Software: Install antivirus software on your devices to help protect them from malicious software that can be distributed through public Wi-Fi networks.

By following these ten tips, you can help ensure you and your sensitive information stay safe while using public Wi-Fi networks. Stay vigilant and informed, and remember always to prioritize cybersecurity and internet safety when browsing online.
