If you're in the market for a new cordless vacuum cleaner, you've probably come across the two biggest names in the game: Dyson and Shark. Both brands offer a range of cordless vacuums, each with its own set of features and benefits. But which one is right for you?

In this post, we're going to compare Dyson and Shark cordless vacuums to help you make an informed decision.

## Dyson Cordless Vacuums

Dyson is a well-known brand in the world of vacuum cleaners, and for good reason. Their cordless models are some of the most popular on the market, thanks to their powerful motors, long battery life, and sleek design.

Here are some of the best Dyson cordless vacuums:

### Dyson V10

The Dyson V10 is a powerful cordless vacuum that can handle just about any mess. It comes with a variety of attachments, including a crevice tool, dusting brush, and motorized floor tool, making it perfect for both carpet and hard floors.

The V10 has a run time of up to 60 minutes, depending on the mode you're using. It also has a hygienic bin emptying system, which means you don't need to touch any dirt or debris. The downsides of this model are its high price and relatively long charging time.

### Dyson V8

The Dyson V8 is another popular model, which is a bit more affordable than the V10. It features a powerful motor and a run time of up to 40 minutes on a single charge.

The V8 also has a hygienic bin emptying system and comes with a range of attachments for different cleaning tasks. However, its dustbin capacity is relatively small, which means you may need to empty it more frequently than other models.

## Shark Cordless Vacuums

Shark is another popular brand of cordless vacuum cleaners. Their models tend to be more affordable than Dyson, while still offering plenty of useful features.

Here are some of the best Shark cordless vacuums:

### Shark IF281

The Shark IF281 is a versatile cordless vacuum that comes with two removable, rechargeable batteries. This means you can keep one battery charging while you use the other, giving you continuous cleaning power.

The IF281 also has a variety of attachments, including a pet multi-tool, crevice tool, and dusting brush. It has a run time of up to 80 minutes when both batteries are fully charged, making it perfect for larger homes.

### Shark IZ362H

The Shark IZ362H is a lightweight and powerful cordless vacuum that can be used as a handheld or stick vacuum. It comes with several attachments, including a crevice tool, dusting brush, and pet multi-tool.

The IZ362H has a run time of up to 50 minutes on a single charge and has a self-cleaning brush roll to handle pet hair and other debris. The biggest downside of this model is that it can be a bit noisy during use.

## Dyson vs. Shark: Which is Better?

When it comes to choosing between Dyson and Shark cordless vacuums, there's no clear winner. Both brands offer a range of models with different features and benefits.

Dyson vacuums tend to be more powerful and have longer run times, but they also come with a higher price tag. Shark vacuums, on the other hand, tend to be more affordable while still offering plenty of useful features.

Ultimately, the best cordless vacuum for you will depend on your budget, cleaning needs, and personal preferences. Consider factors such as run time, attachments, and noise level when making your decision.

In conclusion, whether you choose Dyson or Shark, you can't go wrong with a cordless vacuum cleaner. These machines offer a convenient and efficient way to keep your home clean and tidy.However, it's important to do your research before making a purchase to ensure you get the best model for your needs.

## Final Thoughts
