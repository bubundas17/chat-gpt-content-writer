Handling form submissions and performing validation are crucial parts of front-end development, and Vue.js makes it easy to do both. Vue.js is a popular front-end JavaScript framework that provides developers with the tools they need to build rich, interactive web applications.

In this beginner's guide, we'll walk you through the steps you need to take to handle form submissions and perform validation in Vue.js. Whether you're new to the framework or a seasoned pro, this tutorial will give you a comprehensive overview of the process.

### Setting up our Project

Before we dive into handling form submissions and validation in Vue.js, we'll need to set up our project. We will use the Vue.js CLI to create a new project shell, which will make it easy for us to organize our files and folders.

First, open your terminal, navigate to your desired folder and run the following command to install the Vue.js CLI globally if you don't already have it installed.

```
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

Then, create a new Vue.js project by running the following command:

```
vue create my-vue-app
```

This will create a new Vue.js project in a folder called `my-vue-app`. Once the project is created, navigate to the project folder and run it in development mode with the following command:

```
cd my-vue-app
npm run serve
```

Now that we have our project set up, we can start working on form handling and validation in Vue.js.

### Creating a Basic Form

First, let's create a basic HTML form in our `App.vue` component. In the `src` folder, open the `App.vue` file and add the following code:

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>My Form</h1>
    <form>
      <label for="name">Name:</label>
      <input type="text" id="name" name="name"><br><br>
      <label for="email">Email:</label>
      <input type="email" id="email" name="email"><br><br>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  </div>
</template>
```

This simple form has two input fields for the user's name and email, along with a submit button. Once submitted, we'll need to handle the form data and perform validation.

### Handling Form Submissions

To handle form submissions in Vue.js, we'll use the `v-on` directive to attach an event listener to the submit button. In the `form` element, add the `v-on:submit` directive with the method we want to call when the form is submitted.

```html
<form v-on:submit="handleSubmit">
```

Then, in the `methods` section of our `App.vue` component, add the `handleSubmit` method that will be invoked when the form is submitted. Inside the `handleSubmit` method, we'll use the `event.preventDefault()` method to prevent the default form submission behavior, which would automatically reload the page.

```js
methods: {
  handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault()
    console.log('Form submitted')
  }
}
```

Now, when the form is submitted, the `handleSubmit` method will be called, and the console will log `"Form submitted"`. We can modify the method to access the form data and perform validation as needed.

### Accessing Form Data

To access the form data, we'll use the `v-model` directive to bind the form inputs to data properties. Add the following `data` properties to the `App.vue` component:

```js
data() {
  return {
    name: '',
    email: ''
  }
}
```

Then, in the input elements, add the `v-model` directive to bind the inputs to the corresponding data properties.

```html
<input v-model="name" type="text" id="name" name="name"><br><br>
<input v-model="email" type="email" id="email" name="email"><br><br>
```

Now, when the user enters values into the input fields, the values will be stored in the `name` and `email` data properties.

In the `handleSubmit` method, we can access the form data by accessing the `name` and `email` properties.

```js
handleSubmit(event) {
  event.preventDefault()
  console.log('Form submitted with name:', this.name, 'and email:', this.email)
}
```

Now, when the form is submitted, the console will log `"Form submitted with name: {name} and email: {email}"`, where `{name}` and `{email}` are the actual values entered by the user.

### Performing Validation

Performing validation is essential to ensure that the form data is correct and meets our requirements. To perform validation in Vue.js, we'll use computed properties and add conditional logic to our `handleSubmit` method.

First, let's create a computed property called `isValid` that will return `true` if the form data passes our validation requirements. In this example, we'll require the user to enter a name and a valid email address.

```js
computed: {
  isValid() {
    return this.name !== '' && this.email.match(/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/)
  }
}
```

This computed property will return `true` if the `name` property is not an empty string and the `email` property matches the regex pattern for a valid email address.

Then, let's add conditional logic to our `handleSubmit` method to handle invalid form submissions.

```js
handleSubmit(event) {
  event.preventDefault()
  if (!this.isValid) {
    alert('Please enter a valid name and email address')
    return
  }
  // Form submission logic
}
```

Now, if the computed `isValid` property returns `false`, the `handleSubmit` method will display an alert message and prevent the form from being submitted. Otherwise, the form submission logic will be executed.

### Conclusion

Handling form submissions and performing validation in Vue.js is a straightforward process with the `v-on` and `v-model` directives. By binding form inputs to data properties, we can access the form data and perform validation as needed.

Whether you're building a simple contact form or a complex interactive application, Vue.js provides the tools you need to make form handling and validation easy and straightforward.

I hope this tutorial has been useful to you, and feel free to experiment with the code and modify it to suit your needs. </EndOFText>
