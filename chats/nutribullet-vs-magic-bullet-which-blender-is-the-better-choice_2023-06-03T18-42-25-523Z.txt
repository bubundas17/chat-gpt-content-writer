Both of these compact blenders are powerful and efficient, but which one should you choose? In this article, we'll compare these two compact blenders and explore their features, performance, price, and more.

## NutriBullet vs Magic Bullet: At a Glance

Before we dive in and compare the features and performance of the NutriBullet and the Magic Bullet in more detail, let's take a quick look at how they stack up against each other.

|                 | NutriBullet         | Magic Bullet         |
| --------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- |
| Power           | 900 watts           | 250 watts            |
| Capacity        | 32 oz.             | 16 oz.               |

| Accessories     | Extra blades, cups  | Extra cups, lids     |
| Special Features| Heating function    | N/A                  |

## Power and Capacity

One of the main differences between the NutriBullet and the Magic Bullet is their power and capacity. The NutriBullet boasts a powerful 900-watt motor, while the Magic Bullet has a 250-watt motor. As a result, the NutriBullet is more powerful and can handle tougher ingredients, such as frozen fruit and ice, with ease. It can also make larger batches, with its 32-ounce cup compared to the Magic Bullet's 16-ounce cup.

However, if you're looking for a blender that is petite and easy to store, the Magic Bullet is a great option.

## Accessories

Both blenders come with different accessories. The NutriBullet comes with extra blades and cups, which can be convenient if you're making multiple smoothies or if you have a household member who also wants to use the blender. On the other hand, the Magic Bullet comes with extra cups and lids, allowing you to take your smoothie on the go.

## Special Features

The NutriBullet also has some special features that the Magic Bullet doesn't have. One of the most notable features of the NutriBullet is its heating function, which allows you to make hot soups and other hot blended recipes. Another handy feature of the NutriBullet is the flip-top to-go lid, which makes drinking your smoothie or shake on the go super easy.

## Price

When it comes to price, the Magic Bullet is considerably cheaper than the NutriBullet. This is mainly because of the difference in power and capacity. The Magic Bullet is a more affordable option for those who don't need a lot of power and aren't making larger batches of food.

## Which One Should You Choose?

Ultimately, the choice between the NutriBullet and the Magic Bullet comes down to your individual needs and priorities. If you're someone who values power and capacity, then the NutriBullet is the better choice. If you don't need as much power and want a compact and affordable blender, then the Magic Bullet might be more suitable for you.

Regardless of which blender you choose, both the NutriBullet and the Magic Bullet are great options for blending up healthy and delicious smoothies, soups, and other blended recipes.
