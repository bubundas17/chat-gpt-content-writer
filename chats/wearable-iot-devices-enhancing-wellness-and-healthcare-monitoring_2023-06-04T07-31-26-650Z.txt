Wearable IoT devices have taken the digital world by storm. These miniature devices are becoming an essential part of modern healthcare and wellness monitoring. The advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled these smart wearable devices to collect vital data and transfer it wirelessly to other connected devices in real-time. With the data readily available and quantified, it becomes easier for healthcare professionals to gain a deeper insight into their patients' health and wellness level and take appropriate actions promptly. Moreover, with their non-invasive monitoring approach, these wearable IoT devices are becoming more popular among patients and healthcare professionals alike.

With the ever-growing popularity of wearable IoT devices, the world of healthcare is undergoing a revolution. Today, doctors and healthcare professionals are increasingly relying on these devices to monitor patients remotely and receive automatic notifications for any critical changes. For instance, the ECG feature included in some of these devices allows a patient's heart rate to be monitored in real-time, providing insights into their cardiac health and allowing early detection of anomalies.

Wearable IoT devices go beyond healthcare monitoring, as they also play an essential role in promoting wellness. These devices are known to inspire positive lifestyle changes, allowing users to track their exercise, steps, active hours, and sleep patterns. Consequently, users can set personalized goals to improve their physical and mental health. Whether in the form of an armband, watch, or pendant, these devices have become ubiquitous in the past few years.

In light of the recent COVID-19 pandemic, wearable IoT devices are being used for contact tracing purposes. The devices collect data on individuals' temperature, location, and proximity, to contact trace and identify potential infection cases. The devices can also ensure the essential healthcare personnel are adequately equipped, with relevant information required to treat the infected while also keeping themselves safe.

The benefits of wearable IoT devices in healthcare monitoring can be vast and unending. Besides early detection of health issues, the collected data can also be used to inform healthcare providers about possible treatments and recommendations for better patient care. By putting this data into context, medical practitioners can make better judgments on patient care strategies and decisions that involve medication, therapy, and other interventions.

In conclusion, the integration of wearable IoT devices into healthcare monitoring and wellness initiatives has brought a paradigm shift in the medical industry, globally. By providing healthcare providers with real-time and accurate information, these devices hold great promise in enhancing patient care and outcomes. They are not only an excellent way to monitor the health of patients in real-time but can also inform long-term care strategies. Additionally, offering the user feedback on personalized metrics has spurred positive lifestyle changes, which could eventually reduce the total cost of healthcare. By improving healthcare monitoring and wellness for patients, wearable IoT devices are shaping the future of medicine.
