React Native is a popular framework for building cross-platform mobile applications. It uses the powerful and flexible ReactJS framework of JavaScript to create mobile apps for both iOS and Android platforms. React Native was released by Facebook in 2015 and has been gaining popularity ever since. In this tutorial, we will discuss how to build mobile apps using the React Native framework.

##Introduction to React Native
React Native is a JavaScript-based framework for building mobile applications that allows you to create native apps for both iOS and Android with a single codebase. This means you can use the same code and components to create apps for multiple platforms, instead of writing separate code for each platform.

React Native is built on top of the ReactJS framework, which allows developers to write code using declarative programming instead of imperative programming, which makes React apps easier to read and maintain.

##Setting Up React Native
Before starting to work with React Native, you'll need to set up your development environment. You'll need to install Node.js, Git, and React Native CLI.

##Creating a new React Native project
Next, let's create a new React Native project. Run the following command in your terminal:

```javascript
npx react-native init myApp
```

This will create a new React Native project with a name of "myApp" in the current directory.

##Running the React Native App
To run the app, enter the following command from within your project directory:

```javascript
npx react-native run-ios
```

This will launch the app in the iOS simulator. You can also launch it in an Android emulator by running `npx react-native run-android`.

##Creating a React Native Component
In React Native, components are the building blocks of your mobile app. A component is a reusable UI element that can be used repeatedly throughout the app.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const AppHeader = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.text}>Welcome to React Native!</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    height: 200,
    backgroundColor: '#f2f2f2',
  },
  text: {
    fontSize: 30,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    color: '#333',
  },
});

export default AppHeader;
```

With this code, we have created a basic AppHeader component that displays a welcome message.

##Managing State in React Native
State management is an important concept in ReactJS and React Native, and it allows you to update the state of a component and re-render it when the state is updated.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet, TouchableOpacity } from 'react-native';

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  const decrement = () => {
    setCount(count - 1);
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <TouchableOpacity onPress={increment}>
        <Text style={styles.button}>Increment</Text>
      </TouchableOpacity>
      <Text style={styles.text}>{count}</Text>
      <TouchableOpacity onPress={decrement}>
        <Text style={styles.button}>Decrement</Text>
      </TouchableOpacity>
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    height: 200,
    backgroundColor: '#f2f2f2',
  },
  text: {
    fontSize: 30,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    color: '#333',
  },
  button: {
    padding: 10,
    fontSize: 20,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    color: 'white',
    backgroundColor: 'black',
    borderRadius: 5,
    margin: 10,
  },
});

export default Counter;
```
In this example, we've created a basic counter component that utilizes the useState hook to manage state.

##Conclusion
React Native is a powerful tool for building cross-platform mobile applications. With the power and flexibility of ReactJS, you can create dynamic, high-performance apps for both iOS and Android platforms. By utilizing React Native in your next project, you'll be able to save time and money by writing a single codebase for both platforms, instead of separate code for each platform. Try it out and start building your next mobile app today!
