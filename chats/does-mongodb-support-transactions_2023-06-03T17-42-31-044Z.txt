MongoDB is a popular document-oriented database that has gained a lot of attention in recent years. As more and more companies migrate from traditional relational databases to non-relational or NoSQL databases, the demand for features like transactions is increasing. In this article, we will explore everything you need to know about MongoDB transactions and answer the question whether it supports transactions or not.

## What are transactions?

Before we dive into the details of MongoDB transactions, let's define what transactions are. In the context of databases, a transaction is a set of operations that should be executed as a single, atomic unit. For example, transferring money from one bank account to another involves multiple steps like deducting money from one account and adding it to the other account. A transaction ensures that either all the steps are executed successfully, or the entire operation is rolled back.

## ACID properties and transactions

Transactions are often associated with the ACID properties of a database. ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. Atomicity ensures that either all the operations in a transaction are executed successfully or none of them are executed. Consistency ensures that the database state is always valid, even during intermediate stages of a transaction. Isolation ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other. Durability ensures that any transaction that has been committed is permanent and will survive any subsequent failures.

## Does MongoDB support transactions?

The answer to the question is Yes, MongoDB supports transactions. However, MongoDB's support for transactions is relatively new, and it was not until the release of MongoDB 4.0 that full support for multi-document transactions was introduced.

## Types of transactions in MongoDB

MongoDB supports two types of transactions: multi-document transactions and single-document transactions.

### Multi-document transactions

Multi-document transactions in MongoDB allow multiple operations that involve multiple documents to be executed as a single, atomic transaction. Multi-document transactions are supported in MongoDB 4.0 and later versions.

### Single-document transactions

Single-document transactions in MongoDB were added in version 4.2. Single-document transactions allow multiple operations that involve a single document to be executed as a single, atomic transaction.

## Recap

In summary, MongoDB does support transactions, and it provides both multi-document and single-document transactions. With the introduction of multi-document transactions in MongoDB 4.0, MongoDB is now a suitable choice for applications that require ACID-compliant transactions. However, it is important to note that transactions in MongoDB come with some limitations. For example, not all operations support transactions, and transactions can only be performed within a single replica set or a sharded cluster.

We hope this guide has helped you understand the basics of MongoDB transactions. For further reading, we recommend checking out the official MongoDB documentation on transactions.
