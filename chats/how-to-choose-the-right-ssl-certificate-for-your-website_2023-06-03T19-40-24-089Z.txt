Are you a website owner? If so, you must know that website security and authentications are the pillars of your website's success. You don’t want your website to fall prey to cyber attacks, that's why you must encrypt your website to ensure all the sensitive information exchanged through your website is secured. The SSL certificate is an important tool in keeping your website secure and assuring web visitors that your website is authentic.

But, with so many types of SSL certificates available in the market, choosing the right one can be quite daunting and confusing. Furthermore, different SSL certificates have different features, and picking the right one for your website can be a difficult task. In this post, we’ll help you choose the right SSL certificate for your website by highlighting some of the important factors you should consider when shopping for an SSL certificate.

## 1. Type of SSL Certificate

The first factor you should consider is the type of SSL certificate. There are three types of SSL Certificates: Domain Validated (DV), Organization Validated (OV), and Extended Validated (EV).

### Domain Validated Certificates (DV) 

DV SSL certificates are the most basic type of certificate, which only provides encryption for your domain. It only verifies the domain name, but not the organization owning the website.

### Organization Validated Certificates (OV)

OV certificates provide both encryption and verification for the organization owning the website. The validation process includes verifying the organization's information and domain name. 

### Extended Validated Certificates (EV)

EV certificates are the most secure option as they provide the highest level of security. They provide both encryption and validation to ensure your website is authentic. EV certificates display the company name in a green bar within the browser, which assures users about the authenticity of your website.

## 2. Level of Encryption

Apart from validating your website, SSL certificates also provide encryption for data transmitted between the web server and the user's browser. The level of encryption is measured in bits- the higher the bits, the stronger the encryption. You should choose an SSL certificate with 2048-bit encryption or higher for better security.

## 3. Type of Authentication

SSL certificates provide two types of authentication- Single Domain SSL and Wildcard SSL.

### Single Domain SSL

Single Domain SSL certificates encrypt one primary domain and all its sub-domains.

### Wildcard SSL

Wildcard SSL certificates provide encryption for one domain and multiple sub-domains. If you have multiple sub-domains under one parent domain, a Wildcard SSL certificate is ideal.

## 4. Trust and Brand Recognition

Investing in a well-known SSL certificate with a strong reputation is always better to ensure that your users will have trust in your website. SSL providers such as Sectigo, DigiCert, Comodo, and GlobalSign offer SSL certificates with strong reputations of good security and customer service.

## 5. Price

The final factor to consider when choosing an SSL certificate is the price. SSL certificates can range from free to a few hundred dollars per year, depending on the type of certificate, length of validation, and level of encryption. Paid SSL certificates offer more features and better security compared to free SSL certificates.

In conclusion, every business that runs a website should invest in SSL certificate to ensure the security and authenticity of their website. Choosing the right SSL certificate involves considering the type of certificate, the level of encryption, type of authentication, trust and brand recognition, and price. By taking these factors into consideration, you can easily choose the right SSL certificate for your website and keep your business safe and secure.
