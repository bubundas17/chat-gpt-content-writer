Redis is a versatile data store that is primarily used as a caching solution. However, because of its in-memory database structure and lightning-fast data retrieval speed, Redis can be used beyond caching to power messaging systems. In this tutorial, you'll learn how Redis can be used as a message broker or for pub/sub messaging. 

## Redis as a Message Broker

A message broker is an architectural pattern that facilitates communication between systems using messages that are sent and received asynchronously. Redis can function as a message broker due to its ability to store messages and can facilitate communication between different systems. 

Redis is a good fit for a message broker because it supports a key set structure, where the key is a unique identifier for the message, which can be used to send messages between different systems. Some popular messaging systems that use Redis as a message broker include RabbitMQ and ActiveMQ. 

### Redis Configuration for Message Broker

To configure Redis as a message broker, first, you need to set up two databases – one for messages and another one for client endpoints or addresses – using the follow Redis commands:

```bash
redis-cli> CONFIG SET databases 2
```

Next, set the Redis instance up as required for the domain and timeout parameters:

```bash
redis-cli> CONFIG SET prot -1
redis-cli> CONFIG SET timeout 0
```

Then, you need to create two stores within the Redis instance:

```bash
redis-cli> SET messageStore 1
redis-cli> SET clientStore 1
```

### Redis Commands for Message Broker

Redis has a specific set of commands to facilitate communication between different systems using Redis as a message broker. These commands include:

* `PUBLISH` – to publish messages to a channel
* `SUBSCRIBE` – to subscribe to a channel
* `UNSUBSCRIBE` – to unsubscribe from a channel
* `PSUBSCRIBE` – to subscribe to a pattern of channels
* `PUNSUBSCRIBE` – to unsubscribe from a pattern of channels

With these series of commands, Redis can be configured as a message broker between different systems.

## Redis for Pub/Sub Messaging

Redis also supports Pub/Sub messaging, which is a messaging pattern used for multicast messages to multiple clients that subscribe to a channel. Redis Pub/Sub messaging is a powerful tool for building real-time applications like chat applications, notifications systems, or live streaming applications.

### Redis Configuration for Pub/Sub Messaging

To configure Redis for Pub/Sub messaging, you just need to enable the Pub/Sub feature after starting the Redis server instance using the command:

```bash
redis-cli> CONFIG SET notify-keyspace-events KEA
```

### Redis Commands for Pub/Sub Messaging

Redis provides several commands for Pub/Sub messaging. These commands include:

* `PUBLISH` – to publish messages to a channel
* `SUBSCRIBE` – to subscribe to a channel
* `UNSUBSCRIBE` – to unsubscribe from a channel
* `PSUBSCRIBE` – to subscribe to a pattern of channels
* `PUNSUBSCRIBE` – to unsubscribe from a pattern of channels

Redis provides `SUBSCRIBE` and `PUBLISH` commands to facilitate Pub/Sub messaging, and any client can perform the `SUBSCRIBE` or `PUBLISH` commands.

## Conclusion

Redis is a powerful in-memory database that can be leveraged beyond caching to power messaging systems and Pub/Sub applications. In this tutorial, you learned how Redis can be used as a message broker or for pub/sub messaging, and how to configure and use Redis for these purposes. Redis has proven itself to be a reliable, scalable, and speedy message broker or Pub/Sub messaging system, which can facilitate intercommunication between different systems. 

**Note:** It's important to note that Redis is not a full-featured messaging system, and does not provide certain features that full-featured message brokers provide, such as message delivery guarantees, but you can use Redis as a lightweight messaging system when building applications that don't require such guarantees.
