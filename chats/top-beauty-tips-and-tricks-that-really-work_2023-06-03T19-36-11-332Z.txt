Beauty is something every woman desires and works hard to achieve. But, we all know that getting that perfect glowing skin and luscious hair is not an easy feat. It takes a lot of effort, time, and patience. Don't worry though, I am here to make your journey a little easier by sharing some of my top beauty tips and tricks, that you can rely on to look your best. Read on to know more:

## 1. Don't Skip the Sunscreen
Sunscreen is your best friend when it comes to protecting your skin from the sun's harmful rays. Make sure to choose a sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 and apply it daily, even on cloudy days. This will not only protect your skin from sun damage but also prevent premature aging and dark spots.

## 2. Apply Eye Cream Before Concealer
If you have dark circles under your eyes, applying eye cream before your concealer can help reduce the appearance of dark circles and make you look fresher. The eye cream will also help hydrate the under-eye area, making it easier to apply your concealer.

## 3. Drink Plenty of Water 
Drinking water is crucial for hydrated skin that glows from within. Make sure to drink plenty of water throughout the day to keep your skin looking its best. You can also add fruits like lemon or cucumber to your water for added benefits.

## 4. Use a Deep Conditioning Hair Mask
A deep conditioning hair mask can do wonders for your hair, especially if it’s dry or damaged. Apply the mask once a week and leave it on for 20-30 minutes before rinsing it off. Your hair will be left feeling soft, smooth, and more manageable.

## 5. Don't Neglect Your Neck and Chest
Many of us tend to forget about our neck and chest when it comes to skincare, but they are just as important as our face. Make sure to apply your skincare routine on your neck and chest area as well, and don't forget to apply sunscreen to these areas too.

## 6. Use a Lip Scrub and Balm 
Exfoliating your lips with a scrub and then applying a hydrating lip balm can make your lips look plump and smooth. You can make your own DIY lip scrub using sugar and coconut oil or choose from the many options available in the market.

## 7. Use a Makeup Setting Spray 
Using a makeup setting spray can help your makeup last longer and prevent it from smudging or melting off. Spritz some setting spray after applying your makeup, and you’re good to go!

So, these were some of my top beauty tips and tricks that really work. Remember, consistency is the key when it comes to beauty, so make sure to follow these tips regularly to see the desired results.
