As an online business owner, it’s crucial to have a backup plan in place in case of data loss or site crashes. Backing up your website is one of the most important things you can do to protect your business and your customers. In this guide, we’ll explain how to backup and restore your e-commerce website with your hosting provider.

## Why Backing Up Your Website Is Important

Your website is the backbone of your online business. Imagine losing all of your products, customer data, and website design due to a hack or software malfunction. This can not only affect your revenue but also your reputation and customer trust.

Creating and maintaining regular backups of your website is essential as it can help you to quickly restore your website after any unexpected data loss, malicious attacks or hardware failure.

## Types of Website Backups

Website backups can be divided into two categories, Full Backups and Incremental Backups.

#### Full Backups

A full backup is a complete copy of your entire website files, databases, and configurations. This backup type takes up more storage space but provides the most comprehensive backup of your website.

#### Incremental Backups

An incremental backup is regularly scheduled to back up only the changes made since the last backup. This type of backup is much faster and uses less storage space.

## Creating Website Backups

Your web host should provide an automated backup service for your website. Review your hosting provider’s backup options, understand what’s included in their backup plan, and set up automated backups if available. If this is not available or not satisfying, try using backups plugins.

### Backup with cPanel

Most web hosts offer cPanel as their control panel interface. Here’s how you can backup a cPanel website:

1. Login to your cPanel control panel.
2. Navigate to the “Backup” icon.
3. Click on “Download a Full Website Backup” and select the location to save the backup.
4. Click “Generate Backup”.

### Backup with a Plugin

If your website utilizes a CMS platform such as WordPress, or you’re not using a cPanel interface, another way to backup your website is by using a backup plugin such as UpdraftPlus or BackupBuddy.

1. Install and activate the plugin from the CMS platform’s plugin store.
2. Navigate to the settings area and configure your desired backup settings.
3. Schedule the plugin to backup your website and databases regularly.

## Restoring Your Website

If something went wrong with your website and you need to restore from a backup, here's how to do it.

### Restore from a cPanel Backup

1. Login to your cPanel control panel.
2. Navigate to the “Backup” icon.
3. Under the “Restore a Full Backup/cpmove File” section, upload your backup file.
4. Your website is now restored.

### Restore from a Plugin Backup

1. Navigate to the settings area of your backup plugin.
2. In the backups list section, locate the backup you’d like to restore.
3. Click on restore and follow the given instructions.

## Conclusion

Backing up your website can seem like a tedious task, but it is essential. Your business’ survival depends on being able to get back up and running after an unexpected crash or hack attack.

Make sure that your hosting provider has an automatic backup service in place. If not, invest in a backup plugin and schedule regular backups. Test each backup with a restore process so that you can ensure that you are protecting your data effectively. By following these steps, your E-commerce site will be well-protected and able to recover any lost data.
