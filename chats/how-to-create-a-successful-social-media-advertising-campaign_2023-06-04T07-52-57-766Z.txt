For example, Facebook and Instagram are great for driving website traffic and conversions, while LinkedIn is ideal for B2B marketing. Choose the platforms that align with your campaign goals and target audience. 

5. Monitor and Analyze Your Campaign 
The work doesn't end when your campaign goes live. You need to track the performance of your ads and make adjustments as needed. Monitor your ad spend, engagement rates, click-through rates, and conversions. Use the insights gained to optimize your campaign and improve performance. 

6. Test and Experiment
