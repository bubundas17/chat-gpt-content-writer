Vue Router is a powerful and flexible router for Vue.js applications. It allows you to easily handle navigation between pages, create dynamic routes, and even implement nested or nested child routes. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the basics of using Vue Router to add in navigation to your Vue.js application, including setting up and configuring routes, navigating between pages, working with dynamic routes and more.

## Setting Up Vue Router in Your Application

Before you can start using Vue Router, you'll need to add it to your Vue.js application. You can install Vue Router using npm or yarn. Run the following command to install Vue Router:

``` bash
npm install vue-router --save
```

Once you have installed Vue Router, you need to set it up in your main Vue.js application. You can do this by creating a new instance of the Vue Router and passing in an array of routes. Here's an example:

``` javascript
import Vue from 'vue'
import VueRouter from 'vue-router'

Vue.use(VueRouter)

const routes = [
  { path: '/', component: Home },
  { path: '/about', component: About },
  { path: '/contact', component: Contact }
]

const router = new VueRouter({
  routes
})

new Vue({
  router
}).$mount('#app')
```

In this example, we import Vue and VueRouter, which we then attach to the Vue instance with `Vue.use(VueRouter)`. We define an array of routes, which maps paths to Vue components. Finally, we create an instance of VueRouter and pass it our routes. We then create a new Vue instance and pass our router instance to it with `new Vue({ router })`.

## Navigating Between Pages

With our routes set up, we can now navigate between pages in our Vue.js application. We can do this using the `<router-link>` component. This component renders an anchor tag that links to one of our defined routes.

Here's an example of how we can use `<router-link>` to navigate to the home page of our Vue.js application:

``` html
<router-link to="/">Home</router-link>
```

With this code, when a user clicks on the "Home" link, they will be directed to the path defined for the `/` route.

We can also use the `$router` property on a Vue component to navigate programmatically between pages. Here's an example:

``` javascript
this.$router.push('/')
```

In this code, we are using `$router.push()` to programmatically navigate the user to the home page.

## Dynamic Routes

Vue Router also allows us to handle dynamic routes. Dynamic routes are useful when you want to display different content or data depending on the particular URL being accessed. For example, consider the URL `/users/123`. We might want to display different content depending on the user ID in the URL.

To define a dynamic route, we use a colon before the route parameter name. Here's an example:

``` javascript
const routes = [
  { path: '/users/:id', component: User }
]
```

With this code, we are defining a dynamic route that matches any URL that starts with `/users/` and has an ID parameter. We can access this parameter in our `User` component using `this.$route.params.id`.

## Nested Routes

Vue Router also supports nested routes, which allows you to create more complex navigational structures in your Vue.js application. To create a nested route, we simply define child routes as part of a parent route.

Here's an example of how we can define nested routes:

``` javascript
const routes = [
  { path: '/users', component: Users,
    children: [
      { path: '', component: UserList },
      { path: ':id', component: UserProfile }
    ]
  }
]
```

In this code, we have defined a parent route for `/users` that has two child routes: one for the user list (`''`) and one for a user profile (`':id'`). We can then render the child components using nested `<router-view>` components:

``` html
<router-view></router-view>
<router-view name="sidebar"></router-view>
```

In this code, we have two nested `<router-view>` components: one for the main content and one for a sidebar. We can render a specific component in a named `<router-view>` using the `name` attribute.

## Conclusion

Vue Router is a powerful and flexible router for Vue.js applications. With Vue Router, you can easily handle navigation between pages, create dynamic routes, and even implement nested or nested child routes.

In this tutorial, we covered the basics of using Vue Router, including setting up and configuring routes, navigating between pages, working with dynamic routes, and more. With these fundamental concepts under your belt, you'll soon be able to build complex navigational structures in your Vue.js application.## Handling Navigation Guards

In some cases, you may want to prevent a user from navigating to a certain route if certain conditions are not met. Vue Router comes with a set of [navigation guards](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/advanced/navigation-guards.html) that allow you to define behavior for various points in the navigation process.

For example, you may want to ensure that a user is authenticated before navigating to the "Settings" page of your application. Here's an example of how we can use the `beforeEnter` navigation guard to prevent access to the "Settings" page if the user is not authenticated:

``` javascript
const routes = [
  { path: '/settings', component: Settings,
    beforeEnter: (to, from, next) => {
      if (!isAuthenticated) {
        next('/login')
      } else {
        next()
      }
    }
  }
]
```

In this code, we've defined a `beforeEnter` guard for the `/settings` route. Inside the `beforeEnter` function, we check if the user is authenticated. If not, we redirect the user to the login page (`/login`). Otherwise, we allow the user to proceed to the "Settings" page.

## Lazy Loading Routes

If your application has a large number of routes or complex components, you may want to consider lazy loading your routes. Lazy loading allows you to load components only when they are needed, improving performance and reducing the initial page load time.

You can lazy load routes in Vue Router by using the `component` property of a route to specify a `component` function. This function should return a `Promise` that resolves to a component definition. Here's an example:

``` javascript
const routes = [
  { path: '/settings', component: () => import('./Settings.vue') }
]
```

In this code, we've defined a lazy-loaded route for the `/settings` path. When the user navigates to this path, Vue Router will load the `Settings.vue` component asynchronously.

## Conclusion

Vue Router is a powerful and flexible router that can help you create complex navigation structures in your Vue.js application. With Vue Router, you can set up routes, navigate between pages, handle dynamic and nested routes, and more.

In this tutorial, we've covered the basics of using Vue Router, including setting up and configuring routes, navigating between pages, working with dynamic routes, creating nested routes, and handling navigation guards. We've also talked about lazy loading routes to improve the performance of your application.

Hopefully, this guide has given you a good starting point for using Vue Router in your own projects. Happy routing!
