Flying can be a stressful experience, and one of the most significant factors that can either alleviate or exacerbate that stress is the airline's customer service. Customer service can make all the difference between a memorable flight experience and a horrid one. In this post, we will compare two leading airlines in the US- American Airlines and Delta. Specifically, we'll be looking into their customer service offerings to determine which one is better.

American Airlines has been a major player in the airline industry since it was founded in 1930. Similarly, Delta Air Lines has been around since 1925, and both airlines offer high safety standards, extensive domestic and international routes, and diverse in-flight amenities. But when it comes to customer service, which airline has the edge?

## Customer Service Metrics Comparison

### Delayed Flights

Delayed flights can bring a sense of panic and anxiety to travelers, regardless of their destination. Therefore, dealing with delayed flights is an essential customer service metric for any airline.

American Airlines has a better track record when it comes to delayed flights. According to the US Department of Transportation data for August 2021, American Airlines' percentage of on-time arrivals was 84.7%. In contrast, Delta's on-time arrival percentage was 82.6%.

### Cancelled Flights

Canceled flights can be a deal-breaker for many passengers, as it can affect their travel plans and cause inconvenience during their trip.

Both American Airlines and Delta Air Lines have a low cancellation rate, but American Airlines edges out Delta in this metric. The US Department of Transportation data for August 2021 shows that American Airlines' cancellation rate was 0.5%, while Delta's was at 0.9%.

### Baggage Handling

Luggage handling is one of the common sources of complaints among airline customers. Losing luggage or delaying the delivery could ruin a passenger's entire trip. So, how do American Airlines and Delta compare when it comes to baggage handling?

Both airlines offer excellent baggage handling services, but according to the Air Travel Consumer Reports from August 2021, Delta Airlines had a lower mishandled baggage rate (1.77 per 1,000 passengers) than American Airlines (2.49 per 1,000 passengers).

### In-Flight Experience

Another vital customer service metric that sets airlines apart is the in-flight experience. A comfortable flight experience is a crucial factor that determines whether customers will fly with an airline again or not.

Both American Airlines and Delta offer state-of-the-art in-flight amenities, but Delta seems to have a more comprehensive offering. Delta has received industry recognition for its unmatched commitment to customer comfort. The airline offers personal in-flight entertainment screens, a 34-inch pitch for economy seats (compared to 30-32 inches in American Airlines), and complimentary in-flight Wi-Fi.

## Final Verdict

In summary, both American Airlines and Delta Air Lines are excellent choices for domestic and international travel. However, when it comes to customer service, each airline has its strengths.

American Airlines performs better in delayed flights, but Delta Air Lines has a lower mishandled baggage rate and some of the best in-flight amenities. Ultimately, the right choice depends on your preferences and the routes you will be traveling.

So, before booking your next flight, consider your needs and wants, and do a little comparison research between the two airlines to decide which airline suits your travel style best.ENDOFTEXT
