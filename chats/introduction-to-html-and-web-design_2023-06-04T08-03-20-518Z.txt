HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the building block of most websites. Whether you're looking to build your own site or just want to learn the basics of web design, understanding HTML is a must. In this comprehensive beginner's guide, we'll take a look at the basics of HTML and web design, including the tools you'll need to get started.

Getting Started with HTML
The first step to learning HTML is to understand what it is and how it works. HTML is the language used to create the structure of a webpage. It uses a series of tags to define elements like headers, paragraphs, images, and links. To get started with HTML, all you need is a basic text editor. You can use anything from Notepad to Atom or Sublime Text.

HTML Tags and Elements
Tags are used to define elements in HTML. There are dozens of HTML tags, each with its own unique function. Some common tags you'll use include:

- `<html>`: This tag defines the root of an HTML document.
- `<head>`: This tag contains the metadata for your page, like the title and links to stylesheets.
- `<body>`: This tag contains the content of your page.
- `<h1>`-`<h6>`: These tags define headings, with `h1` being the largest and `h6` the smallest.
- `<p>`: This tag defines a paragraph.
- `<a>`: This tag creates a hyperlink.
- `<img>`: This tag defines an image.
- `<ul>`: This tag creates an unordered list.
- `<li>`: This tag defines a list item.
- `<div>` and `<span>`: These tags define containers for other elements.

CSS Stylesheets
In addition to HTML, a stylesheet language called CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style websites. CSS allows you to control everything from font sizes and colors to layout and spacing. CSS stylesheets can be included in your HTML document using the `<link>` tag.

Building Your Own Website
Once you've got a handle on HTML and CSS, you can start building your own website. There are a number of tools and frameworks that can make the process easier, like Bootstrap and WordPress. When building your own site, it's important to keep in mind factors like usability, accessibility, and responsive design.

Conclusion
HTML may seem intimidating at first, but with a little practice, you'll soon be building your own websites. Remember to start small and take it one step at a time. As you become more comfortable with HTML and web design, you can start exploring more advanced techniques like JavaScript and responsive design.
