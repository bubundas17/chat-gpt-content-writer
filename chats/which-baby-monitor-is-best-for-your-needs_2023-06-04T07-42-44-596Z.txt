Are you a new parent wondering which baby monitor to buy? With so many options on the market, it can be overwhelming to choose the right one for your needs. A baby monitor is an essential tool for parents who want to keep an eye on their baby while they sleep or play in the nursery. In this guide, we’ll help you understand the different types of baby monitors available and recommend some of the best ones on the market.

## Types of Baby Monitors

Baby monitors come in different types and styles, each with its own benefits and drawbacks.

### Audio Monitors

Audio monitors are the most basic type of baby monitor. They have a transmitter and receiver, and the transmitter is placed in the baby's room while the receiver stays with the parent. Audio monitors can pick up sounds from the baby's room and transmit them to the parent so they can hear if their baby is crying or making noise.

### Video Monitors

Video monitors have a camera that is placed in the baby's room, and a monitor that displays what the camera is seeing. Some video monitors also have the option to pan, tilt, and zoom the camera for a better view of the baby. Video monitors are a great option for parents who want to see their baby visually, as well as hear them.

### Movement Monitors

Movement monitors are designed to detect if a baby stops moving or breathing. They have a sensor pad that is placed under the baby's mattress, and if no movement is detected for a set amount of time, an alarm will sound. Movement monitors are a great option for parents who want extra peace of mind and are worried about SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome).

### Smart Monitors

Smart monitors are a newer and more high-tech type of baby monitor. They connect to your smartphone or tablet and use Wi-Fi to transmit audio and video of your baby. Smart monitors often have additional features such as the ability to play lullabies, take photos or videos, and monitor room temperature and humidity levels.

## What to Look for When Choosing a Baby Monitor

When choosing a baby monitor, there are several factors to consider to ensure you choose the right one for your needs.

### Range

Consider the size of your home and where you will want to use the monitor. Some baby monitors have a limited range, which may be fine for a small apartment or house, but not suitable for larger homes or multiple floors.

### Battery life

If you're after a portable and wireless monitor option, check the battery life as it can vary between monitors. Some monitors will require constant charging, which can be frustrating for frequent users.

### Additional Features

Consider what additional features are important to you. Do you want a monitor with temperature sensors, handheld portability, a video feed, or smart connectivity?

### Price

Lastly, consider the price range of the monitors you're interested in. While some smart monitors can be pricey, some audio monitors can be very affordable.
