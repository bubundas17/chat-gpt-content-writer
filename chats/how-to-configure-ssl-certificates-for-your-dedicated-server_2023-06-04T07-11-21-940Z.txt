In the digital age, where cybersecurity threats are prevalent, securing your website is crucial. One way to secure your website is by implementing SSL/TLS certificates. SSL certificates build trust with your website visitors and encrypt the data being transmitted between their browser and your website. In this article, we’ll provide a step-by-step guide on how to configure SSL certificates for your dedicated server and ensure your website’s security.

## What are SSL/TLS Certificates?

SSL certificates, also known as TLS certificates, are digital certificates that establish a secure and encrypted connection between a web server and a browser. SSL certificates ensure that all data transmitted between the browser and server are unreadable to anyone without the private key to decrypt the data. SSL certificates use HTTPS protocol to communicate with the web server, which can help prevent eavesdropping, tampering, and phishing attacks.

## Choosing the Right SSL Certificate

Before installing an SSL certificate, you need to choose the right type of certificate that suits your website’s needs. There are three types of SSL certificates:

1. Domain Validated (DV) Certificates: This type of certificate is the easiest and quickest to obtain. It verifies only that you own the domain and does not validate your business identity.

2. Organization Validated (OV) Certificates: This type of certificate provides more security than DV certificates. It verifies both your domain ownership and verifies that your business is authentic and registered.

3. Extended Validation (EV) Certificates: This type of certificate is the most secure and provides the highest level of trust. It includes a rigorous verification process that validates your domain ownership, your business identity, and legal existence.

## SSL Certificate Installation Process

Here is a step-by-step guide to follow when installing SSL certificates for your dedicated server:

### Step 1: Activate SSL Using Control Panel

The majority of hosting providers will have a control panel that allows you to activate SSL. Simply go to the control panel and enable SSL.

### Step 2: Generate CSR

Next, you need to generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR). The CSR is a code that helps identify your organization and domain name when requesting a certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA). You can generate a CSR through the control panel or via command line.

### Step 3: Submit CSR to Certification Authority

After generating the CSR, you need to submit it to a Certification Authority (CA) to have it signed. A CA will verify the information provided on the CSR and will issue a signed SSL certificate.

### Step 4: Install the SSL Certificate

Once you receive the signed SSL/TLS certificate from the CA, you can now install it on your dedicated server. You can install the certificate via control panel or command line.

### Step 5: Test Your SSL Certificate

After installing the SSL certificate, you need to test it to ensure that it's working. You can use various online tools that check if the certificate is installed correctly or use browser-based tools.

## Conclusion

By now, you should have a clear understanding of how SSL certificates work and how to configure them on your dedicated server. SSL certificates help to establish trust and security between you and your website visitors. Remember, SSL certificates are not optional- they are a must-have for any website. So, secure your website today and foster a trustworthy relationship with your visitors!
