Website backup and recovery is a critical task that website owners must regularly perform to ensure that their online presence is safe from data loss caused by website crashes, malware attacks, cyber threats, and other related disruptions. While there are many ways to back up and recover websites, it is essential to understand the dos and don'ts of website backup and recovery to avoid costly mistakes.

In this article, we will review essential practices and tools that website owners can use to keep their websites safe, and recover them quickly in the event of a disaster. Here are the crucial dos and don'ts of website backup and recovery:

The Dos of Website Backup and Recovery

1. Do plan for Disaster Recovery
Having a disaster recovery plan is a critical prerequisite for website owners to ensure business continuity in the event of a disaster. A disaster recovery plan outlines the steps to be taken in the event of an unexpected disaster, such as a cyberattack or a natural disaster. Planning for Disaster Recovery can help reduce the consequences of data loss and the time it takes to recover from a disaster.

2. Do back up your website regularly
The frequency of website backups depends on the amount of website data generated daily or weekly. A general rule of thumb is that website owners should perform full backups at least once a week, and then incremental backups daily. This approach minimizes data loss, as only the data created or updated since the last backup is lost if a disaster occurs.

3. Do store backups in a secure location
Store website backups in a location separate from the website files or server. This approach ensures that backups are accessible in the event of a disaster, such as a server crash, without compromising the security of the backup files. It is also advisable to use offsite cloud storage solutions such as Google Drive, Dropbox, or Amazon S3, as they provide quick and secure access to website data, in addition to allowing for automatic backups.

4. Do use backup plugins or tools
Using backup plugins or tools can simplify the process of backing up and recovering website data. Most website hosting providers offer backup solutions as part of their services, while others rely on third-party plugins such as BackupBuddy, VaultPress or UpdraftPlus. These tools offer various features such as scheduled backups, automatic backups, one-click restores, and more.

5. Do test your backups regularly
Testing your backups regularly ensures that the backups are not corrupt and that they can be restored quickly and efficiently. Perform a full test restore of your website in a staging environment, and compare it to the live version of your website. This step confirms that the backups are complete, accurate, and functional, and ensures peace of mind if a disaster occurs.

The Don'ts of Website Backup and Recovery

1. Don't ignore cybersecurity threats
Cyber threats such as malware, phishing attacks, and ransomware are increasingly common, making website backup and recovery more critical than ever. Ignoring cybersecurity threats can lead to catastrophic consequences, including data loss, potential damage to reputation, and financial losses. Monitor your website for suspicious activities regularly, and invest in security solutions such as firewalls, anti-virus and backup plugins to mitigate any potential threats.

2. Don't rely on a single backup source
Create multiple backups and store them in different locations to avoid data loss in case of a disaster. Relying on a single backup source, such as a hosting provider's backup, is not enough, as it leaves you vulnerable to data loss in case a failure occurs. Keep copies of backups on different devices or cloud-based storage solutions that have their data redundancy.

3. Don't forget to backup all essential files
Website owners must backup all essential files, including the website database, theme files, backend files, in addition to multimedia and other content files. Failure to back up all essential website files can lead to data loss if a disaster occurs.

4. Don't skip website maintenance
Regular website maintenance, including updates to themes, plugins, and other backend files, can help prevent data loss, cyber threats, and performance issues. Ignoring website maintenance can result in outdated software that is vulnerable to threats, website crashes due to compatibility issues, or poor website performance.

5. Don't assume that backups are always reliable
While backups are essential for website backup and recovery, they are not always reliable. Ensure that the backup tools used are up to date, regularly test backups, keep backups in secure locations, and have a comprehensive backup and disaster recovery plan that addresses various contingencies.

Website backup and recovery is a crucial task that website owners need to undertake regularly. By following these essential dos and don'ts, website owners can ensure that their websites remain safe from cyber threats and data loss, and recover quickly in the event of a disaster.Regularly backing up essential files, planning for disaster recovery, storing backups in a secure location, using backup plugins or tools, and testing backups are essential steps for successful website backup and recovery. Conversely, website owners must avoid cybersecurity threats, relying on a single backup source, skipping website maintenance, assuming backups are always reliable, and failing to backup all essential files.

Website backup and recovery may be a daunting task, but it is essential for website owners and businesses to maintain business continuity and avoid costly data loss. By following the dos and don'ts of website backup and recovery, website owners can minimize the chances of data loss, reduce the time to recover from a disaster, and improve overall website security.

In summary, website backup and recovery is a critical task that website owners must undertake regularly. Regular backups, a disaster recovery plan, secure storage, backup plugins or tools, and regular testing are crucial for successful website backup and recovery. By avoiding cybersecurity threats, relying on a single backup source, skipping website maintenance, assuming backups are always reliable, and failing to backup all essential files, website owners can improve website security, reduce the risk of data loss, and ensure business continuity.
