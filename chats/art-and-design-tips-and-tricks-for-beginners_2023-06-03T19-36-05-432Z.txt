If you're a beginner artist or designer, at some point you may find yourself stuck or feeling uninspired. Fortunately, there are a number of tips and tricks you can use to boost your creativity, strengthen your skills, and get those creative juices flowing. Here are 12 essential art and design tips and tricks for beginners:

1. Start with the basics – Before diving into more complex techniques, it's important to master the basics. Practice drawing basic shapes, such as circles, triangles, and squares, before moving on to more complex forms.

2. Experiment with different tools – Don't limit your creativity to just one tool or medium. Try experimenting with different pencils, paintbrushes, digital programs, or any other tools that may inspire you.

3. Sketch regularly – Sketcing regularly can help you strengthen your skills and boost your creativity. Keep your sketchbook with you at all times, and take opportunities to sketch whenever possible.

4. Take a break – If you're feeling stuck, take a break. Clearing your mind can often help you find new inspiration and ideas.

5. Analyze other artists' work – Look to other artists and designers for inspiration and learn new techniques from them. Analyze their work to understand what makes it successful.

6. Work with a friend – Collaborating with a friend can help you gain new perspectives and ideas. Plus, it's always more fun to create with others.

7. Practice, practice, practice – The more you practice, the easier it will be to create. Set aside time each day or week to practice, and you’ll soon see improvements in your skills.

8. Use color strategically – Color can enhance your work, but it can also detract from it if used poorly. Learn color theory and experiment with different color schemes to find what works best for you.

9. Keep things simple – Sometimes, less is more. Try simplifying your work to better communicate your message or idea.

10. Get feedback – Sharing your work with others can help you gain valuable feedback and improve your skills. Seek out constructive criticism and apply it to your work.

11. Stay open-minded – Be open to new ideas and techniques. Trying something new might lead to inspiration you never would have found otherwise.

12. Don't give up – Everyone has creative blocks and setbacks. Remember to keep pushing through and stay committed to your art and design goals.

Incorporating these tips and tricks into your art and design process can help you become a better artist or designer and strengthen your skills. Keep working hard and don't forget to have fun!
