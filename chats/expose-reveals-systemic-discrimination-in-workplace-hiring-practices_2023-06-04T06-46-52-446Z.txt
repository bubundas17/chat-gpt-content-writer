In today's rapidly changing world, diversity and inclusion have become more than just buzzwords. They are now essential components of any successful organization. However, despite the progress many companies have made in hiring a diverse workforce, there is still evidence of systemic discrimination in workplace hiring practices.

In this exposé, we will delve into the various strategies that organizations use to weed out minority candidates during the recruitment process. We will also explore how these discriminatory practices often operate under the guise of "unconscious bias" training.

We begin by examining the use of screening tools, such as resume scanning software and pre-employment tests. While these tools can help employers sift through a large number of applications, they may inadvertently filter out qualified, but underrepresented candidates. 

Another way employers can discriminate is by creating job descriptions that are tailored to specific demographics that don't include or welcome diverse applicants. They could also use LinkedIn or other social networking job postings that can exclude individuals from historically marginalized communities.

Unconscious bias is a common defense employers use to justify discriminatory practices. Companies may require all employees to take a mandatory training session that promises to "eliminate unconscious bias." While this seems like a step in the right direction, there is little to no evidence that such training is effective, and the bias is difficult, if not impossible, to completely remove. Unfortunately, it can often lead to a false sense of progress and a feeling of complacency among employers, leading to the problems being ignored or minimized. 

These practices reinforce structural inequalities that have been entrenched for decades. They also deprive companies of the benefits of a diverse workforce. A study conducted by McKinsey & Company concluded that companies with diverse teams outperform peers who lack diversity.

Ultimately, we must acknowledge that these discriminatory practices continue to harm marginalized groups and hinder progress towards a more inclusive workplace. Companies must commit to identifying and dismantling these practices truly. They could also verify their job descriptions for discriminatory language. By doing so, they can gain a competitive edge while welcoming talented employees who have previously been excluded.

At the end of the day, inclusivity isn't just good morals; it makes good business sense. Only when companies genuinely embrace diversity and inclusivity will we be able to create a truly equitable society.
