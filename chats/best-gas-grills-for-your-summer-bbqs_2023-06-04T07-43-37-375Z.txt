Gas grills are the perfect solution for summer BBQs and outdoor cooking. They're fast, convenient, and easy to use. But with so many options on the market, it can be overwhelming to choose the right one for your needs. That's why we've created this comprehensive guide to the top gas grills you can buy. 

Before we get into the details, let's talk about some of the things to consider when buying a gas grill. First, think about how much cooking space you'll need. For smaller gatherings and families, a grill with 400-500 square inches of cooking space should suffice. For larger gatherings or if you plan on entertaining frequently, go for a grill with at least 500-600 square inches of cooking space. 

Next, consider the type of grates you want. Porcelain-coated grates are easy to clean but can chip over time. Cast iron grates provide excellent heat retention but can be more difficult to clean. Stainless steel grates are durable and heat up quickly, but can be prone to sticking. 

Also, think about the type of burners you want. Stainless steel burners are durable and rust-resistant, while brass burners provide better heat distribution. 

When shopping for a gas grill, also consider the brand's reputation, warranty, and customer service. And now, without further ado, here are our top picks for the best gas grills on the market. 

1. Weber Spirit II E-310 - This grill boasts 529 square inches of cooking space and three powerful burners. The porcelain-coated grates are easy to clean, and the built-in thermometer makes it easy to monitor heat levels. 

2. Char-Broil Performance 650 - This grill has an impressive 650 square inches of cooking space and six burners, making it perfect for large gatherings. The stainless steel grates and burners are durable, and the side shelves provide ample space for prep work. 

3. Dyna-Glo DGE Series - This grill has a whopping 708 square inches of cooking space and five burners, perfect for feeding a crowd. The cast iron grates provide excellent heat retention, and the built-in thermometer makes it easy to monitor temperature levels. 

4. Broil King Regal S590 Pro - This grill has 625 square inches of cooking space and five stainless steel burners. The cast iron grates provide excellent cooking performance, and the built-in side burner is perfect for sauces and side dishes. 

5. Nexgrill Evolution 5-Burner - This grill has 717 square inches of cooking space and five stainless steel burners, making it perfect for larger gatherings. The porcelain-coated grates are easy to clean, and the side burner adds versatility to your outdoor cooking.
