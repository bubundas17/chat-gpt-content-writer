Athletic wear and footwear make a significant market in sports and fitness. Nike and Adidas are two superpowers that have dominated the industry for years. Both companies have a plethora of products ranging from sneakers to sportswear and accessories. However, the burning question is, which brand is superior to the other? In this post, we aim to compare Nike and Adidas in detail to figure out the better brand.

**History**

Adidas is a German multinational corporation that was founded by Adolf Dassler in 1949. Adidas is an abbreviation for the founder's name - Adi from Adolf and Das from Dassler. Initially, the company made sports shoes, but it soon began producing sportswear and lifestyle items. Adidas's three-stripe logo is one of the most recognizable logos in the world.

Nike, on the other hand, is a US-based company founded in 1964. Nike's founders, Bill Bowerman and Phil Knight, started the company as Blue Ribbon Sports, and it was not until 1971 that the company was renamed Nike. The name Nike comes from the Greek goddess of victory, which relates to sports' competitive nature.

**Products**

Both Nike and Adidas produce a wide range of athletic apparel, accessories, and footwear. Nevertheless, Nike is renowned for sneakers that are usually innovative, visually appealing, and comfortable. Nike continuously pushes the boundaries of footwear technology, with shoe releases like the Flyknit and the Lunarlon cushioning system.

Adidas, on the other hand, is renowned for its soccer boots and made an iconic soccer shoe with the Adidas Copa Mundial. Recently, Adidas has increased its shoe and clothing range with collaborations with icons such as Kanye West, Beyonc√©, and Pharrell Williams.

**Popularity**

Although popularity is not the only way to measure a brand's superiority, it is a crucial factor to consider. Nike has a slight edge over Adidas in terms of popularity and market share. This can be attributed to Nike's considerable marketing budget and high profile sponsorships of world-class athletes like Lebron James and Michael Jordan. 

Adidas is not far behind in market share and popularity either. They have maintained their number two position in the athletic wear market and have also sponsored several influential athletes like Lionel Messi and James Harden.

**Brand reputation**

Another essential factor in determining a brand's superiority is its reputation. A brand with a good reputation tends to attract and retain customers. Both Nike and Adidas have built up good reputations over the years, and they are highly respected among athletes.

Nike's brand reputation is built on the innovative product releases, collaborations with athletes, and sponsorship of sport's biggest events. They are also known for their commitment to corporate responsibility throughout their supply chain.

Adidas, on the other hand, has a reputation for quality, durability, and comfort. Adidas has always been associated with soccer, but they have branched out to several other sports, including basketball and running.

**Pricing**

Finally, the pricing of products is an important factor that affects a brand's superiority. Nike's prices are generally higher than Adidas, partly due to Nike's heavy focus on research and development, and high profile marketing campaigns. Adidas aims to market itself as the brand for the average person with reasonable prices while still ensuring the products' quality.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the battle between Nike and Adidas is a close one. Both brands offer high-quality products, but Nike is slightly ahead of Adidas in terms of perceived superiority, backed by strong marketing and many high-profile sponsorships. On the other hand, Adidas's brand reputation for quality, durability, and comfort makes it a significant contender in the athletic wear market. In the end, it comes down to personal preference, and both Nike and Adidas have something for everyone.
