Are you trying to decide whether to buy the iPhone 12 or Samsung Galaxy S20? One of the many factors to consider is camera performance. In this post, we will compare the cameras of these two devices to determine which one comes out on top.

**Megapixels**

Both the iPhone 12 and Samsung Galaxy S20 have impressive camera specifications. The iPhone 12 has a dual-camera system comprised of a 12-megapixel wide lens and a 12-megapixel ultra-wide lens, while the Samsung Galaxy S20 has a triple-camera setup consisting of a 12-megapixel wide lens, 64-megapixel telephoto lens, and 12-megapixel ultra-wide lens.

At first glance, it may appear that the Galaxy S20's higher megapixel count gives it an advantage over the iPhone 12. However, more megapixels does not necessarily equate to better image quality. 

**Low-Light Performance**

One area where the Samsung Galaxy S20 shines is in low-light photography. The device boasts an impressive Night Mode, which uses multi-frame stacking to capture brighter and more detailed photos in low-light conditions. The iPhone 12 also has Night Mode, but it does not perform as well as the Galaxy S20's Night Mode.

**Video Quality**

When it comes to video recording, both devices are capable of capturing 4K video at 60 frames per second. The iPhone 12 also has a trick up its sleeve with its Dolby Vision HDR recording capability, allowing for richer and more vibrant colors in video recordings.

**Other Camera Features**

Beyond traditional photo and video capabilities, both devices also have unique camera features. The Samsung Galaxy S20 has a 3x optical zoom and a 30x digital zoom, allowing for more versatility when framing shots. Meanwhile, the iPhone 12 has a LiDAR scanner, which enhances autofocus performance and enables advanced augmented reality experiences.

**Verdict**

Overall, both the iPhone 12 and Samsung Galaxy S20 have impressive camera performance. In terms of sheer specifications, the Galaxy S20 appears to have the edge with its triple-camera system and higher megapixel count. However, when it comes to low-light performance and video quality, the iPhone 12 holds its own and even surpasses the Galaxy S20 in some respects.

Ultimately, the choice between these two devices will come down to personal preference. If you prioritize low-light performance and advanced video recording capabilities, the Samsung Galaxy S20 may be the right choice for you. But if you value overall camera versatility and innovative features, the iPhone 12 may be the better pick.

-END-In the end, both the iPhone 12 and Samsung Galaxy S20 have their strengths and weaknesses. It's up to you to decide which one suits your needs and preferences better. Consider your usage, what features are essential to you, and your budget before making a final decision.

We hope this comparison between the cameras of the iPhone 12 and Samsung Galaxy S20 has been useful. With the knowledge gained from this post, you're one step closer to making an informed buying decision.
