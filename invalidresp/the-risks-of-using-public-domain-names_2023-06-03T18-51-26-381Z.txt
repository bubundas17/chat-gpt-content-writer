The internet provides a wealth of resources and information just a click away. It's also where you can purchase and secure a domain name for your website. From small business owners to bloggers, choosing a domain name is an integral part of creating a strong online presence. But there are a few risks involved when using a public domain name for your website. Read on to learn about the hidden dangers of using public domain names, and what you can do to protect yourself from unnecessary high-risk security breaches.

##What Are Public Domain Names?

Public domain names are website names simultaneously used by multiple domain name registrants. The practice of using identical names for multiple registration is called bulk registration, and it's a common strategy for those wanting to make a quick profit. Using a public domain name is often a cheaper and easier way to secure a web address, as there may be a significant discount offered to registrants who use a bulk registration service.

##The Risks of Using Public Domain Names

Using public domain names may appear to be a great idea, especially if you're trying to save money. However, it comes with significant risks that can be detrimental to your online safety and security. Here are some of the hidden dangers that come with public domain names:

1. **Your website may be caught in the middle of a trademark dispute.** Public domain names may be associated with another company or a registered trademark. If this happens, you could be accused of trademark infringement and forced to remove your website.

2. **Your website could be hacked more easily.** A public domain name is a lot easier to hack than a unique domain name. Public domain names are often targeted specifically because they are easy to breach. Hackers know that if they target a common domain name, then they can breach hundreds of websites with one attack.

3. **It can damage your online branding and reputation.** A public domain name does not give you the opportunity to create your unique brand on the web. It is common for buyers of public domain names to use the business name or domain name of an existing business. The lack of originality can cause potential customers to question your legitimacy.

##How to Protect Yourself from Security Breaches

Keeping yourself protected from cyber attacks is critical. Here are some ways to safeguard your website from the inherent risks that come with using a public domain name:

1. **Avoid using a public domain name.** It may cost more to register a unique domain name. However, it provides significant security advantages. Choose a more original domain name that fits your branding.

2. **Obtain an SSL certificate.** An SSL certificate helps ensure that any information exchanged between your website and its visitors is encrypted and secure.

3. **Keep your website updated.** Regular website maintenance keeps all your data and information stored safely. 

4. **Use two-factor authentication.** A two-factor authentication system can protect your website from various forms of cyber-attacks.

##Bottom Line

Using a public domain name may seem like an excellent idea, but it is not worth the risks that come with it. A unique domain name is more expensive and might require more effort, but it is a secure long-term investment for your website and your brand. Be proactive and protect yourself from the risks that come with public domain names.
