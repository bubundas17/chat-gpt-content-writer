Are you a serious gamer looking for the best 4K TV brand for your gaming experience? With so many options out there, it can be challenging to decide which one to choose. In this article, we will take a close look at two popular TV brands Vizio and Sony and compare their performance when it comes to gaming.

Vizio is a California-based company that produces budget-friendly 4K TVs with excellent smart features, while Sony is known for its high-end 4K OLED TVs that offer unmatched picture quality. Let's dive deeper into the features of each brand and see which one is best for gaming.

**Input Lag**

Input lag is the time it takes for the TV to display an image after receiving a signal. Gamers know that even the slightest delay in input lag can ruin their gaming experience. In this category, Vizio wins hands down with its M-Series and P-Series TVs. Vizio's M-Series and P-Series have an input lag of 15.5 milliseconds and 12.9 milliseconds, respectively. Sony's Bravia OLED TV has an input lag of 26 milliseconds, which is not bad but still falls behind Vizio's P-Series when it comes to gaming performance.

**Refresh Rate**

The refresh rate refers to how many times a TV can update its image in a second. It is measured in Hertz (Hz). The higher the refresh rate, the smoother the image, and the better the gaming experience. In this category, Sony takes the lead with its OLED Bravia TV's refresh rate of 120 Hz. Vizio's P-Series comes in second with a refresh rate of 60 Hz, while the M-Series has a refresh rate of 120 Hz.

Picture quality is an important factor to consider when buying a 4K TV for gaming. Sony's OLED TVs are well known for their exceptional picture quality, while Vizio's color accuracy is impressive for its price point. However, both brands offer excellent picture quality, making it a challenging category to judge.

**Smart Features**

Both Vizio and Sony offer smart TV features that allow you to access streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video. Vizio's SmartCast interface is known for its ease of use and navigation. On the other hand, Sony's Android TV offers more apps and a wider range of Google services.

**Price**

Price is often a decisive factor when choosing a TV brand. Vizio's M-Series and P-Series are competitively priced and offer excellent value for money. Sony's OLED TVs come with a premium price tag but offer unmatched picture quality, making them worth the investment.

**Conclusion**

When it comes to gaming performance, Vizio's P-Series and M-Series TVs are the clear winners, thanks to their low input lag and impressive refresh rates.
