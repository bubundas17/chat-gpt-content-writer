MeteorJS is an open-source JavaScript web development framework that allows developers to quickly create real-time web applications. With its extensive set of pre-built packages and libraries, MeteorJS simplifies the development process by providing a framework for building scalable and responsive web applications.

This beginner's guide will introduce you to the fundamentals of web development with MeteorJS and demonstrate how you can use this framework to build real-time web applications.

## Getting Started with MeteorJS

Before you can start building web applications with MeteorJS, you need to install the MeteorJS framework. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Download MeteorJS from the official website (https://www.meteor.com/install)
2. Install MeteorJS by running the installation file and following the prompts
3. Once installation is complete, open a terminal window and type `meteor --version` to confirm that MeteorJS has been installed correctly

## Creating Your First MeteorJS Application

Once you have MeteorJS installed, you're ready to start building your first web application!

To create a new MeteorJS application, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you want to create your application
2. Type `meteor create <application name>` to create a new MeteorJS application
3. Change into the new application directory by typing `cd <application name>`
4. Start the MeteorJS server by typing `meteor`

Once the server has started, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view your new MeteorJS application.

## Understanding the Structure of a MeteorJS Application

A typical MeteorJS application is made up of several key components, including:

- **Client:** This is where your client-side code resides, including HTML templates and JavaScript files.
- **Server:** This is where your server-side code resides, including your application logic and database models.
- **Collections:** Collections are used to store data on the server and allow you to interact with the database from within your application.
- **Routing:** Routing is used to define the URLs for your pages and the corresponding templates and controllers.

It's important to understand how these components work together in a MeteorJS application, as it will help you to develop your application more efficiently.

## Building a Real-Time MeteorJS Application

One of the most powerful features of MeteorJS is its ability to create real-time web applications. To demonstrate this feature, we'll build a simple chat application.

### Client-Side Code

First, let's create the HTML template for our chat application:

```HTML
<template name="chat">

  <div id="messages">
    {{#each messages}}
      <div class="message">
        <span class="username">{{username}}:</span>
        <span class="text">{{text}}</span>
      </div>
    {{/each}}
  </div>

  <form>
    <input type="text" name="text" id="text" placeholder="Type your message...">
    <button type="submit">Send</button>
  </form>

</template>
```

In this HTML template, we've defined a section for displaying the chat messages and a form for submitting new messages.

Next, let's add the JavaScript code to handle sending and receiving messages:

```JavaScript
// Define a new collection to store chat messages
Messages = new Mongo.Collection('messages');

// Subscribe to the 'messages' collection on the server
Meteor.subscribe('messages');

// Define a helper to retrieve the chat messages
Template.chat.helpers({
  messages: function() {
    return Messages.find({}, { sort: { timestamp: -1 } });
  }
});

// Define an event handler to handle submitting new messages
Template.chat.events({
  'submit form': function(event, template) {
    event.preventDefault();
    var text = template.$('#text').val();
    Messages.insert({ text: text, timestamp: new Date(), username: 'User' });
    template.$('#text').val('');
  }
});
```

In this JavaScript code, we've defined a new collection for storing chat messages, subscribed to that collection on the server, defined a helper to retrieve the chat messages, and defined an event handler to handle submitting new chat messages.

### Server-Side Code

On the server, we'll define methods for retrieving and inserting chat messages:

```JavaScript
Meteor.methods({
  getMessages: function() {
    return Messages.find({}, { sort: { timestamp: -1 } }).fetch();
  },

  addMessage: function(text) {
    Messages.insert({ text: text, timestamp: new Date(), username: 'User' });
  }
});
```

### Routing

Finally, we'll define the route for our chat application:

```JavaScript
Router.route('/chat', {
  name: 'chat',
  template: 'chat',
  waitOn: function() {
    return Meteor.subscribe('messages');
  }
});
```

## Conclusion

MeteorJS is a powerful web development framework that allows developers to quickly create real-time web applications. With its extensive set of pre-built packages and libraries, MeteorJS simplifies the development process and makes it easy to build scalable and responsive web applications.

In this beginner's guide, we've covered the basics of developing web applications with MeteorJS, including installing the framework, creating a simple application, and building a real-time chat application. With this foundation, you'll be well on your way to developing your own powerful web applications with MeteorJS. 

-ENDOFTEXT-We hope this guide has provided you with a solid foundation to begin exploring the world of web development with MeteorJS. By leveraging the power of MeteorJS, you can quickly develop and deploy scalable, real-time web applications with ease.
