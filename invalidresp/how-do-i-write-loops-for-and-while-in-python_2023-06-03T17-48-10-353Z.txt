TOPIC: How do I write loops (for and while) in Python

Loops are extremely useful constructs in programming languages that allow you to repeat a set of instructions multiple times. Python provides two main loop constructs: the for loop and the while loop. In this tutorial, we will cover both of them and show you how to use them effectively in your code.

Python For Loops
----------------
A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string), executing a set of statements for each item in the sequence. The basic syntax of a for loop in Python is as follows:

```
for variable in sequence:
    # statements to execute 
```

Here, `variable` is the loop variable, which takes on the value of each item in the sequence one at a time. The loop body consists of one or more statements that are indented under the `for` statement. These statements are executed for each item in the sequence.

For example, suppose you have a list of numbers and you want to print each number in the list:

```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for num in numbers:
    print(num)
```

The output of this code would be:

```
1
2
3
4
5
```

Python While Loops
------------------
A while loop is another type of loop available in Python. It is used when you want to repeat a set of statements while a condition is true. The basic syntax of a while loop in Python is:

```
while condition:
    # statements to execute 
```

Here, `condition` is an expression that evaluates to True or False. As long as `condition` is True, the loop body will continue to execute. When the condition becomes False, the loop terminates.

For example, suppose you want to print the numbers from 1 to 5 using a while loop:

```
num = 1
while num <= 5:
    print(num)
    num += 1
```

The output of this code would be:

```
1
2
3
4
5
```

In this example, the `num` variable starts at 1, and the loop continues to execute as long as `num` is less than or equal to 5. Inside the loop, we print the value of `num` and then increment it by 1 using the `+=` operator.

Loop Control Statements
-----------------------
Python provides two important loop control statements that you can use in combination with both the for and while loops:

1. `break`: Terminates the loop and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop.

2. `continue`: Skips the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next iteration.

Let's take a look at an example of using a `break` statement inside a for loop:

```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for num in numbers:
    if num == 3:
        break
    print(num)
```

The output of this code would be:

```
1
2
```

As you can see, when `num` is equal to 3, the `break` statement terminates the loop.

Now, let's take a look at an example of using a `continue` statement inside a while loop:

```
num = 0
while num < 5:
    num += 1
    if num == 3:
        continue
    print(num)
```

The output of this code would be:

```
1
2
4
5
```

As you can see, when `num` is equal to 3, the `continue` statement skips the rest of the loop body for that iteration and moves on to the next iteration.

Conclusion
----------
Loops are an essential part of programming in Python, and they allow you to automate repetitive tasks and iterate over collections of data. In this tutorial, we've covered the basics of writing for and while loops in Python, and we've shown you how to use loop control statements to modify the behavior of your loops. With this knowledge, you'll be able to write effective and efficient code that can handle a variety of different scenarios.continue
