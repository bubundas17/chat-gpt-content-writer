If you are working with PostgreSQL, you will need to know how to query data from a table. In this tutorial, we will show you different ways to query data from a table in PostgreSQL.

First, connect to your PostgreSQL server using the psql command-line interface or any PostgreSQL client tool.

SELECT Statement
The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from a table. Here’s the syntax:
```
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```
You can also use a wildcard (*) to select all columns:
```
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```

WHERE Clause
You can use the WHERE clause to filter data based on certain conditions. Here’s the syntax:
```
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```
For example:
```
SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE price > 100;
```

ORDER BY Clause
The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set. Here’s the syntax:
```
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column_name ASC|DESC;
```
For example:
```
SELECT *
FROM products
ORDER BY price DESC;
```

LIMIT and OFFSET Clause
You can use the LIMIT clause to limit the number of rows returned by a query. Here’s the syntax:
```
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
LIMIT number_of_rows;
```
For example:
```
SELECT *
FROM products
LIMIT 10;
```
You can also use the OFFSET clause to skip a certain number of rows before returning the result set. Here’s the syntax:
```
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
LIMIT number_of_rows
OFFSET offset_value;
```
For example:
```
SELECT *
FROM products
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20;
```

JOINs
You can use JOINs to combine data from two or more tables into a single result set. Here are the different types of JOINs in PostgreSQL:
- INNER JOIN
- LEFT JOIN
- RIGHT JOIN
- FULL OUTER JOIN

Here’s an example of an INNER JOIN:
```
SELECT *
FROM orders
JOIN customers
ON orders.customer_id = customers.id;
```

With these commands you will be able to select and manipulate data in PostgreSQL. Remember to always sanitize user input to prevent SQL injection attacks.

-END OF TEXT-I hope this tutorial has been helpful in teaching you how to query data from a table in PostgreSQL. Remember that this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to PostgreSQL and SQL. There are many more advanced techniques and commands that you can use to manipulate data in PostgreSQL.

If you want to learn more about PostgreSQL, we recommend reading the official documentation or blogs from experts in the field. The PostgreSQL community is helpful and active, so don’t be afraid to ask questions or participate in discussions.
